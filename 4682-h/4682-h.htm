<h2><a name="chap00"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>
The author of this book offers it to the public without apology. The reviewers
of his previous work of this character have presumed, on inductive grounds,
that he must be a young man from the most westerly part of the Western States,
to whom many things might be pardoned as due to the exuberant animal spirits of
youth. They were good enough to express the thought that when the author grew
up and became educated there might be hope for his intellect. This expectation
is of no avail. All that education could do in this case has been tried and has
failed. As a Professor of Political Economy in a great university, the author
admits that he ought to know better. But he will feel amply repaid for his
humiliation if there are any to whom this little book may bring some passing
amusement in hours of idleness, or some brief respite when the sadness of the
heart or the sufferings of the body forbid the perusal of worthier things.

<h2><a name="chap01"></a>I.<br />
Maddened by Mystery:<br />
or, The Defective Detective</h2>

<p>
The great detective sat in his office. He wore a long green gown and half a
dozen secret badges pinned to the outside of it.
</p>

<p>
Three or four pairs of false whiskers hung on a whisker-stand beside him.
</p>

<p>
Goggles, blue spectacles and motor glasses lay within easy reach.
</p>

<p>
He could completely disguise himself at a second&rsquo;s notice.
</p>

<p>
Half a bucket of cocaine and a dipper stood on a chair at his elbow.
</p>

<p>
His face was absolutely impenetrable.
</p>

<p>
A pile of cryptograms lay on the desk. The Great Detective hastily tore them
open one after the other, solved them, and threw them down the cryptogram-shute
at his side.
</p>

<p>
There was a rap at the door.
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective hurriedly wrapped himself in a pink domino, adjusted a pair
of false black whiskers and cried,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus02"></a>
<a href="images/image02.jpg">
<img src="images/image02.jpg" width="358" height="500" alt="Illustration:" /></a>
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>
His secretary entered. &ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;it is
you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He laid aside his disguise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the young man in intense excitement, &ldquo;a mystery
has been committed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the Great Detective, his eye kindling, &ldquo;is it such
as to completely baffle the police of the entire continent?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are so completely baffled with it,&rdquo; said the secretary,
&ldquo;that they are lying collapsed in heaps; many of them have committed
suicide.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;and is the mystery one that is
absolutely unparalleled in the whole recorded annals of the London
police?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;that it involves names
which you would scarcely dare to breathe, at least without first using some
kind of atomiser or throat-gargle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it is connected, I presume, with the highest diplomatic
consequences, so that if we fail to solve it England will be at war with the
whole world in sixteen minutes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His secretary, still quivering with excitement, again answered yes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And finally,&rdquo; said the Great Detective, &ldquo;I presume that it
was committed in broad daylight, in some such place as the entrance of the Bank
of England, or in the cloak-room of the House of Commons, and under the very
eyes of the police?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those,&rdquo; said the secretary, &ldquo;are the very conditions of the
mystery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Great Detective, &ldquo;now wrap yourself in this
disguise, put on these brown whiskers and tell me what it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The secretary wrapped himself in a blue domino with lace insertions, then,
bending over, he whispered in the ear of the Great Detective:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Prince of Wurttemberg has been kidnapped.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective bounded from his chair as if he had been kicked from below.
</p>

<p>
A prince stolen! Evidently a Bourbon! The scion of one of the oldest families
in Europe kidnapped. Here was a mystery indeed worthy of his analytical brain.
</p>

<p>
His mind began to move like lightning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how do you know this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The secretary handed him a telegram. It was from the Prefect of Police of
Paris. It read: &ldquo;The Prince of Wurttemberg stolen. Probably forwarded to
London. Must have him here for the opening day of Exhibition. £1,000
reward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So! The Prince had been kidnapped out of Paris at the very time when his
appearance at the International Exposition would have been a political event of
the first magnitude.
</p>

<p>
With the Great Detective to think was to act, and to act was to think.
Frequently he could do both together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wire to Paris for a description of the Prince.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The secretary bowed and left.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment there was slight scratching at the door.
</p>

<p>
A visitor entered. He crawled stealthily on his hands and knees. A hearthrug
thrown over his head and shoulders disguised his identity.
</p>

<p>
He crawled to the middle of the room.
</p>

<p>
Then he rose.
</p>

<p>
Great Heaven!
</p>

<p>
It was the Prime Minister of England.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You!&rdquo; said the detective.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said the Prime Minister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have come in regard the kidnapping of the Prince of
Wurttemberg?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Prime Minister started.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective smiled his inscrutable smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Prime Minister. &ldquo;I will use no concealment. I
am interested, deeply interested. Find the Prince of Wurttemberg, get him safe
back to Paris and I will add £500 to the reward already offered. But
listen,&rdquo; he said impressively as he left the room, &ldquo;see to it that
no attempt is made to alter the marking of the prince, or to clip his
tail.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So! To clip the Prince&rsquo;s tail! The brain of the Great Detective reeled.
So! a gang of miscreants had conspired to&mdash;but no! the thing was not
possible.
</p>

<p>
There was another rap at the door.
</p>

<p>
A second visitor was seen. He wormed his way in, lying almost prone upon his
stomach, and wriggling across the floor. He was enveloped in a long purple
cloak. He stood up and peeped over the top of it.
</p>

<p>
Great Heaven!
</p>

<p>
It was the Archbishop of Canterbury!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your Grace!&rdquo; exclaimed the detective in
amazement&mdash;&ldquo;pray do not stand, I beg you. Sit down, lie down,
anything rather than stand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Archbishop took off his mitre and laid it wearily on the whisker-stand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are here in regard to the Prince of Wurttemberg.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Archbishop started and crossed himself. Was the man a magician?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;much depends on getting him back. But I have
only come to say this: my sister is desirous of seeing you. She is coming here.
She has been extremely indiscreet and her fortune hangs upon the Prince. Get
him back to Paris or I fear she will be ruined.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Archbishop regained his mitre, uncrossed himself, wrapped his cloak about
him, and crawled stealthily out on his hands and knees, purring like a cat.
</p>

<p>
The face of the Great Detective showed the most profound sympathy. It ran up
and down in furrows. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;the sister of the
Archbishop, the Countess of Dashleigh!&rdquo; Accustomed as he was to the life
of the aristocracy, even the Great Detective felt that there was here intrigue
of more than customary complexity.
</p>

<p>
There was a loud rapping at the door.
</p>

<p>
There entered the Countess of Dashleigh. She was all in furs.
</p>

<p>
She was the most beautiful woman in England. She strode imperiously into the
room. She seized a chair imperiously and seated herself on it, imperial side
up.
</p>

<p>
She took off her tiara of diamonds and put it on the tiara-holder beside her
and uncoiled her boa of pearls and put it on the pearl-stand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have come,&rdquo; said the Great Detective, &ldquo;about the Prince
of Wurttemberg.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wretched little pup!&rdquo; said the Countess of Dashleigh in disgust.
</p>

<p>
So! A further complication! Far from being in love with the Prince, the
Countess denounced the young Bourbon as a pup!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are interested in him, I believe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Interested!&rdquo; said the Countess. &ldquo;I should rather say so.
Why, I bred him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You which?&rdquo; gasped the Great Detective, his usually impassive
features suffused with a carmine blush.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I bred him,&rdquo; said the Countess, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got £10,000
upon his chances, so no wonder I want him back in Paris. Only listen,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;if they&rsquo;ve got hold of the Prince and cut his tail or
spoiled the markings of his stomach it would be far better to have him quietly
put out of the way here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective reeled and leaned up against the side of the room. So! The
cold-blooded admission of the beautiful woman for the moment took away his
breath! Herself the mother of the young Bourbon, misallied with one of the
greatest families of Europe, staking her fortune on a Royalist plot, and yet
with so instinctive a knowledge of European politics as to know that any
removal of the hereditary birth-marks of the Prince would forfeit for him the
sympathy of the French populace.
</p>

<p>
The Countess resumed her tiara.
</p>

<p>
She left.
</p>

<p>
The secretary re-entered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have three telegrams from Paris,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are
completely baffling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He handed over the first telegram.
</p>

<p>
It read:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Prince of Wurttemberg has a long, wet snout, broad ears, very long
body, and short hind legs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective looked puzzled.
</p>

<p>
He read the second telegram.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Prince of Wurttemberg is easily recognised by his deep bark.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then the third.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Prince of Wurttemberg can be recognised by a patch of white hair
across the centre of his back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two men looked at one another. The mystery was maddening, impenetrable.
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me my domino,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These clues must be followed
up,&rdquo; then pausing, while his quick brain analysed and summed up the
evidence before him&mdash;&ldquo;a young man,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;evidently young since described as a &lsquo;pup,&rsquo; with a long, wet
snout (ha! addicted obviously to drinking), a streak of white hair across his
back (a first sign of the results of his abandoned life)&mdash;yes, yes,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;with this clue I shall find him easily.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective rose.
</p>

<p>
He wrapped himself in a long black cloak with white whiskers and blue
spectacles attached.
</p>

<p>
Completely disguised, he issued forth.
</p>

<p>
He began the search.
</p>

<p>
For four days he visited every corner of London.
</p>

<p>
He entered every saloon in the city. In each of them he drank a glass of rum.
In some of them he assumed the disguise of a sailor. In others he entered as a
solider. Into others he penetrated as a clergyman. His disguise was perfect.
Nobody paid any attention to him as long as he had the price of a drink.
</p>

<p>
The search proved fruitless.
</p>

<p>
Two young men were arrested under suspicion of being the Prince, only to be
released.
</p>

<p>
The identification was incomplete in each case.
</p>

<p>
One had a long wet snout but no hair on his back.
</p>

<p>
The other had hair on his back but couldn&rsquo;t bark.
</p>

<p>
Neither of them was the young Bourbon.
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective continued his search.
</p>

<p>
He stopped at nothing.
</p>

<p>
Secretly, after nightfall, he visited the home of the Prime Minister. He
examined it from top to bottom. He measured all the doors and windows. He took
up the flooring. He inspected the plumbing. He examined the furniture. He found
nothing.
</p>

<p>
With equal secrecy he penetrated into the palace of the Archbishop. He examined
it from top to bottom. Disguised as a choir-boy he took part in the offices of
the church. He found nothing.
</p>

<p>
Still undismayed, the Great Detective made his way into the home of the
Countess of Dashleigh. Disguised as a housemaid, he entered the service of the
Countess.
</p>

<p>
Then at last a clue came which gave him a solution of the mystery.
</p>

<p>
On the wall of the Countess&rsquo;s boudoir was a large framed engraving.
</p>

<p>
It was a portrait.
</p>

<p>
Under it was a printed legend:
</p>

<p class="center">
THE PRINCE OF WURTTEMBERG
</p>

<p>
The portrait was that of a Dachshund.
</p>

<p>
The long body, the broad ears, the unclipped tail, the short hind
legs&mdash;all was there.
</p>

<p>
In a fraction of a second the lightning mind of the Great Detective had
penetrated the whole mystery.
</p>

<p>
T<small>HE</small> P<small>RINCE WAS A DOG</small>!!!!
</p>

<p>
Hastily throwing a domino over his housemaid&rsquo;s dress, he rushed to the
street. He summoned a passing hansom, and in a few moments was at his house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; he gasped to his secretary. &ldquo;The mystery is
solved. I have pieced it together. By sheer analysis I have reasoned it out.
Listen&mdash;hind legs, hair on back, wet snout, pup&mdash;eh, what? does that
suggest nothing to you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the secretary; &ldquo;it seems perfectly
hopeless.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective, now recovered from his excitement, smiled faintly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It means simply this, my dear fellow. The Prince of Wurttemberg is a
dog, a prize Dachshund. The Countess of Dashleigh bred him, and he is worth
some £25,000 in addition to the prize of £10,000 offered at the Paris dog show.
Can you wonder that&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment the Great Detective was interrupted by the scream of a woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Countess of Dashleigh dashed into the room.
</p>

<p>
Her face was wild.
</p>

<p>
Her tiara was in disorder.
</p>

<p>
Her pearls were dripping all over the place.
</p>

<p>
She wrung her hands and moaned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They have cut his tail,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;and taken all the hair
off his back. What can I do? I am undone!!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the Great Detective, calm as bronze, &ldquo;do
yourself up. I can save you yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Listen. This is how. The Prince was to have been shown at Paris.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Countess nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your fortune was staked on him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Countess nodded again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The dog was stolen, carried to London, his tail cut and his marks
disfigured.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Amazed at the quiet penetration of the Great Detective, the Countess kept on
nodding and nodding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you are ruined?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she gasped, and sank to the floor in a heap of pearls.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the Great Detective, &ldquo;all is not lost.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He straightened himself up to his full height. A look of inflinchable
unflexibility flickered over his features.
</p>

<p>
The honour of England, the fortune of the most beautiful woman in England was
at stake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; he murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rise dear lady,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Fear nothing. I <small>WILL
IMPERSONATE THE DOG</small><i>!!!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That night the Great Detective might have been seen on the deck of the Calais
packet boat with his secretary. He was on his hands and knees in a long black
cloak, and his secretary had him on a short chain.
</p>

<p>
He barked at the waves exultingly and licked the secretary&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a beautiful dog,&rdquo; said the passengers.
</p>

<p>
The disguise was absolutely complete.
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective had been coated over with mucilage to which dog hairs had
been applied. The markings on his back were perfect. His tail, adjusted with an
automatic coupler, moved up and down responsive to every thought. His deep eyes
were full of intelligence.

<p>
Next day he was exhibited in the Dachshund class at the International show.
</p>

<p>
He won all hearts.
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Quel beau chien!&rdquo;</i> cried the French people.
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Ach! was ein Dog!&rdquo;</i> cried the Spanish.
</p>

<p>
The Great Detective took the first prize!
</p>

<p>
The fortune of the Countess was saved.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately as the Great Detective had neglected to pay the dog tax, he was
caught and destroyed by the dog-catchers. But that is, of course, quite outside
of the present narrative, and is only mentioned as an odd fact in conclusion.

<h2><a name="chap02"></a>II.<br />
&ldquo;Q.&rdquo; A Psychic Pstory of the Psupernatural</h2>

<p>
I cannot expect that any of my readers will believe the story which I am about
to narrate. Looking back upon it, I scarcely believe it myself. Yet my
narrative is so extraordinary and throws such light upon the nature of our
communications with beings of another world, that I feel I am not entitled to
withhold it from the public.
</p>

<p>
I had gone over to visit Annerly at his rooms. It was Saturday, October 31. I
remember the date so precisely because it was my pay day, and I had received
six sovereigns and ten shillings. I remembered the sum so exactly because I had
put the money into my pocket, and I remember into which pocket I had put it
because I had no money in any other pocket. My mind is perfectly clear on all
these points.
</p>

<p>
Annerly and I sat smoking for some time.
</p>

<p>
Then quite suddenly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you believe in the supernatural?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
I started as if I had been struck.
</p>

<p>
At the moment when Annerly spoke of the supernatural I had been thinking of
something entirely different. The fact that he should speak of it at the very
instant when I was thinking of something else, struck me as at least a very
singular coincidence.
</p>

<p>
For a moment I could only stare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I mean is,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;do you believe in phantasms
of the dead?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Phantasms?&rdquo; I repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, phantasms, or if you prefer the word, phanograms, or say if you
will phanogrammatical manifestations, or more simply psychophantasmal
phenomena?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I looked at Annerly with a keener sense of interest than I had ever felt in him
before. I felt that he was about to deal with events and experiences of which
in the two or three months that I had known him he had never seen fit to speak.
</p>

<p>
I wondered now that it had never occurred to me that a man whose hair at
fifty-five was already streaked with grey, must have passed through some
terrible ordeal.
</p>

<p>
Presently Annerly spoke again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Last night I saw Q,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I ejaculated. I did not in the least know who Q
was, but it struck me with a thrill of indescribable terror that Annerly had
seen Q. In my own quiet and measured existence such a thing had never happened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;I saw Q as plainly as if he were
standing here. But perhaps I had better tell you something of my past
relationship with Q, and you will understand exactly what the present situation
is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Annerly seated himself in a chair on the other side of the fire from me,
lighted a pipe and continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When first I knew Q he lived not very far from a small town in the south
of England, which I will call X, and was betrothed to a beautiful and
accomplished girl whom I will name M.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Annerly had hardly begun to speak before I found myself listening with riveted
attention. I realised that it was no ordinary experience that he was about to
narrate. I more than suspected that Q and M were not the real names of his
unfortunate acquaintances, but were in reality two letters of the alphabet
selected almost at random to disguise the names of his friends. I was still
pondering over the ingenuity of the thing when Annerly went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When Q and I first became friends, he had a favourite dog, which, if
necessary, I might name Z, and which followed him in and out of X on his daily
walk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In and out of X,&rdquo; I repeated in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;in and out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My senses were now fully alert. That Z should have followed Q out of X, I could
readily understand, but that he should first have followed him in seemed to
pass the bounds of comprehension.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;Q and Miss M were to be married.
Everything was arranged. The wedding was to take place on the last day of the
year. Exactly six months and four days before the appointed day (I remember the
date because the coincidence struck me as peculiar at the time) Q came to me
late in the evening in great distress. He had just had, he said, a premonition
of his own death. That evening, while sitting with Miss M on the verandah of
her house, he had distinctly seen a projection of the dog R pass along the
road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Did you not say that the
dog&rsquo;s name was Z?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Annerly frowned slightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Z, or more correctly Z R, since Q
was in the habit, perhaps from motives of affection, of calling him R as well
as Z. Well, then, the projection, or phanogram, of the dog passed in front of
them so plainly that Miss M swore that she could have believed that it was the
dog himself. Opposite the house the phantasm stopped for a moment and wagged
its tail. Then it passed on, and quite suddenly disappeared around the corner
of a stone wall, as if hidden by the bricks. What made the thing still more
mysterious was that Miss M&rsquo;s mother, who is partially blind, had only
partially seen the dog.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Annerly paused a moment. Then he went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This singular occurrence was interpreted by Q, no doubt correctly, to
indicate his own approaching death. I did what I could to remove this feeling,
but it was impossible to do so, and he presently wrung my hand and left me,
firmly convinced that he would not live till morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;and he died that night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, he did not,&rdquo; said Annerly quietly, &ldquo;that is the
inexplicable part of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; I said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He rose that morning as usual, dressed himself with his customary care,
omitting none of his clothes, and walked down to his office at the usual hour.
He told me afterwards that he remembered the circumstances so clearly from the
fact that he had gone to the office by the usual route instead of taking any
other direction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Did anything unusual happen to mark
that particular day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I anticipated that you would ask that question,&rdquo; said Annerly,
&ldquo;but as far as I can gather, absolutely nothing happened. Q returned from
his work, and ate his dinner apparently much as usual, and presently went to
bed complaining of a slight feeling of drowsiness, but nothing more. His
stepmother, with whom he lived, said afterwards that she could hear the sound
of his breathing quite distinctly during the night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And did he die that night?&rdquo; I asked, breathless with excitement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;he did not. He rose next morning feeling
about as before except that the sense of drowsiness had apparently passed, and
that the sound of his breathing was no longer audible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Annerly again fell into silence. Anxious as I was to hear the rest of his
astounding narrative, I did not like to press him with questions. The fact that
our relations had hitherto been only of a formal character, and that this was
the first occasion on which he had invited me to visit him at his rooms,
prevented me from assuming too great an intimacy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;Q went to his office each day after
that with absolute regularity. As far as I can gather there was nothing either
in his surroundings or his conduct to indicate that any peculiar fate was
impending over him. He saw Miss M regularly, and the time fixed for their
marriage drew nearer each day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Each day?&rdquo; I repeated in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;every day. For some time before his
marriage I saw but little of him. But two weeks before that event was due to
happen, I passed Q one day in the street. He seemed for a moment about to stop,
then he raised his hat, smiled and passed on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you will allow me a question that
seems of importance&mdash;did he pass on and then smile and raise his hat, or
did he smile into his hat, raise it, and then pass on afterwards?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your question is quite justified,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;though I
think I can answer with perfect accuracy that he first smiled, then stopped
smiling and raised his hat, and then stopped raising his hat and passed
on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the essential fact is this: on the
day appointed for the wedding, Q and Miss M were duly married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; I gasped; &ldquo;duly married, both of them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;both at the same time. After the
wedding Mr. and Mrs. Q&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Q,&rdquo; I repeated in perplexity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Q&mdash;- for after the
wedding Miss M. took the name of Q&mdash;- left England and went out to
Australia, where they were to reside.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop one moment,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and let me be quite
clear&mdash;in going out to settle in Australia it was their intention to
reside there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;that at any rate was generally
understood. I myself saw them off on the steamer, and shook hands with Q,
standing at the same time quite close to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and since the two Q&rsquo;s, as I suppose
one might almost call them, went to Australia, have you heard anything from
them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Annerly, &ldquo;is a matter that has shown the same
singularity as the rest of my experience. It is now four years since Q and his
wife went to Australia. At first I heard from him quite regularly, and received
two letters each month. Presently I only received one letter every two months,
and later two letters every six months, and then only one letter every twelve
months. Then until last night I heard nothing whatever of Q for a year and a
half.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I was now on the tiptoe of expectancy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; said Annerly very quietly, &ldquo;Q appeared in this
room, or rather, a phantasm or psychic manifestation of him. He seemed in great
distress, made gestures which I could not understand, and kept turning his
trouser pockets inside out. I was too spellbound to question him, and tried in
vain to divine his meaning. Presently the phantasm seized a pencil from the
table, and wrote the words, &lsquo;Two sovereigns, to-morrow night,
urgent.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Annerly was again silent. I sat in deep thought. &ldquo;How do you interpret
the meaning which Q&rsquo;s phanogram meant to convey?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;it means this. Q, who is evidently
dead, meant to visualise that fact, meant, so to speak, to deatomise the idea
that he was demonetised, and that he wanted two sovereigns to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how,&rdquo; I asked, amazed at Annerly&rsquo;s instinctive
penetration into the mysteries of the psychic world, &ldquo;how do you intend
to get it to him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I intend,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;to try a bold, a daring
experiment, which, if it succeeds, will bring us into immediate connection with
the world of spirits. My plan is to leave two sovereigns here upon the edge of
the table during the night. If they are gone in the morning, I shall know that
Q has contrived to de-astralise himself, and has taken the sovereigns. The only
question is, do you happen to have two sovereigns? I myself, unfortunately,
have nothing but small change about me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here was a piece of rare good fortune, the coincidence of which seemed to add
another link to the chain of circumstance. As it happened I had with me the six
sovereigns which I had just drawn as my week&rsquo;s pay.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Luckily,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am able to arrange that. I happen to
have money with me.&rdquo; And I took two sovereigns from my pocket.
</p>

<p>
Annerly was delighted at our good luck. Our preparations for the experiment
were soon made.
</p>

<p>
We placed the table in the middle of the room in such a way that there could be
no fear of contact or collision with any of the furniture. The chairs were
carefully set against the wall, and so placed that no two of them occupied the
same place as any other two, while the pictures and ornaments about the room
were left entirely undisturbed. We were careful not to remove any of the
wall-paper from the wall, nor to detach any of the window-panes from the
window. When all was ready the two sovereigns were laid side by side upon the
table, with the heads up in such a way that the lower sides or tails were
supported by only the table itself. We then extinguished the light. I said
&ldquo;Good night&rdquo; to Annerly, and groped my way out into the dark,
feverish with excitement.
</p>

<p>
My readers may well imagine my state of eagerness to know the result of the
experiment. I could scarcely sleep for anxiety to know the issue. I had, of
course, every faith in the completeness of our preparations, but was not
without misgivings that the experiment might fail, as my own mental temperament
and disposition might not be of the precise kind needed for the success of
these experiments.
</p>

<p>
On this score, however, I need have had no alarm. The event showed that my mind
was a media, or if the word is better, a transparency, of the very first order
for psychic work of this character.
</p>

<p>
In the morning Annerly came rushing over to my lodgings, his face beaming with
excitement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Glorious, glorious,&rdquo; he almost shouted, &ldquo;we have succeeded!
The sovereigns are gone. We are in direct monetary communication with Q.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I need not dwell on the exquisite thrill of happiness which went through me.
All that day and all the following day, the sense that I was in communication
with Q was ever present with me.
</p>

<p>
My only hope was that an opportunity might offer for the renewal of our
inter-communication with the spirit world.
</p>

<p>
The following night my wishes were gratified. Late in the evening Annerly
called me up on the telephone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come over at once to my lodgings,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Q&rsquo;s
phanogram is communicating with us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I hastened over, and arrived almost breathless. &ldquo;Q has been here
again,&rdquo; said Annerly, &ldquo;and appeared in the same distress as before.
A projection of him stood in the room, and kept writing with its finger on the
table. I could distinguish the word &lsquo;sovereigns,&rsquo; but nothing
more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you not suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that Q for some reason which
we cannot fathom, wishes us to again leave two sovereigns for him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Annerly enthusiastically, &ldquo;I believe
you&rsquo;ve hit it. At any rate, let us try; we can but fail.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That night we placed again two of my sovereigns on the table, and arranged the
furniture with the same scrupulous care as before.
</p>

<p>
Still somewhat doubtful of my own psychic fitness for the work in which I was
engaged, I endeavoured to keep my mind so poised as to readily offer a mark for
any astral disturbance that might be about. The result showed that it had
offered just such a mark. Our experiment succeeded completely. The two coins
had vanished in the morning.
</p>

<p>
For nearly two months we continued our experiments on these lines. At times
Annerly himself, so he told me, would leave money, often considerable sums,
within reach of the phantasm, which never failed to remove them during the
night. But Annerly, being a man of strict honour, never carried on these
experiments alone except when it proved impossible to communicate with me in
time for me to come.
</p>

<p>
At other times he would call me up with the simple message, &ldquo;Q is
here,&rdquo; or would send me a telegram, or a written note saying, &ldquo;Q
needs money; bring any that you have, but no more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On my own part, I was extremely anxious to bring our experiments prominently
before the public, or to interest the Society for Psychic Research, and similar
bodies, in the daring transit which we had effected between the world of
sentience and the psycho-astric, or pseudo-ethereal existence. It seemed to me
that we alone had succeeded in thus conveying money directly and without
mediation, from one world to another. Others, indeed, had done so by the
interposition of a medium, or by subscription to an occult magazine, but we had
performed the feat with such simplicity that I was anxious to make our
experience public, for the benefit of others like myself.
</p>

<p>
Annerly, however, was averse from this course, being fearful that it might
break off our relations with Q.
</p>

<p>
It was some three months after our first inter-astral psycho-monetary
experiment, that there came the culmination of my experiences&mdash;so
mysterious as to leave me still lost in perplexity.
</p>

<p>
Annerly had come in to see me one afternoon. He looked nervous and depressed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have just had a psychic communication from Q,&rdquo; he said in answer
to my inquiries, &ldquo;which I can hardly fathom. As far as I can judge, Q has
formed some plan for interesting other phantasms in the kind of work that we
are doing. He proposes to form, on his side of the gulf, an association that is
to work in harmony with us, for monetary dealings on a large scale, between the
two worlds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My reader may well imagine that my eyes almost blazed with excitement at the
magnitude of the prospect opened up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Q wishes us to gather together all the capital that we can, and to send
it across to him, in order that he may be able to organise with him a corporate
association of phanograms, or perhaps in this case, one would more correctly
call them phantoids.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I had no sooner grasped Annerly&rsquo;s meaning than I became enthusiastic over
it.
</p>

<p>
We decided to try the great experiment that night.
</p>

<p>
My own worldly capital was, unfortunately, no great amount. I had, however,
some £500 in bank stock left to me at my father&rsquo;s decease, which I could,
of course, realise within a few hours. I was fearful, however, lest it might
prove too small to enable Q to organise his fellow phantoids with it.
</p>

<p>
I carried the money in notes and sovereigns to Annerly&rsquo;s room, where it
was laid on the table. Annerly was fortunately able to contribute a larger sum,
which, however, he was not to place beside mine until after I had withdrawn, in
order that conjunction of our monetary personalities might not dematerialise
the astral phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
We made our preparations this time with exceptional care, Annerly quietly
confident, I, it must be confessed, extremely nervous and fearful of failure.
We removed our boots, and walked about on our stockinged feet, and at
Annerly&rsquo;s suggestion, not only placed the furniture as before, but turned
the coal-scuttle upside down, and laid a wet towel over the top of the
wastepaper basket.
</p>

<p>
All complete, I wrung Annerly&rsquo;s hand, and went out into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
I waited next morning in vain. Nine o&rsquo;clock came, ten o&rsquo;clock, and
finally eleven, and still no word of him. Then feverish with anxiety, I sought
his lodgings.
</p>

<p>
Judge of my utter consternation to find that Annerly had disappeared. He had
vanished as if off the face of the earth. By what awful error in our
preparations, by what neglect of some necessary psychic precautions, he had met
his fate, I cannot tell. But the evidence was only too clear, that Annerly had
been engulfed into the astral world, carrying with him the money for the
transfer of which he had risked his mundane existence.
</p>

<p>
The proof of his disappearance was easy to find. As soon as I dared do so with
discretion I ventured upon a few inquiries. The fact that he had been engulfed
while still owing four months&rsquo; rent for his rooms, and that he had
vanished without even having time to pay such bills as he had outstanding with
local tradesmen, showed that he must have been devisualised at a moment&rsquo;s
notice.
</p>

<p>
The awful fear that I might be held accountable for his death, prevented me
from making the affair public.
</p>

<p>
Till that moment I had not realised the risks that he had incurred in our
reckless dealing with the world of spirits. Annerly fell a victim to the great
cause of psychic science, and the record of our experiments remains in the face
of prejudice as a witness to its truth.

<h2><a name="chap03"></a>III.<br />
Guido the Gimlet of Ghent:<br />
A Romance of Chivalry</h2>

<p>
It was in the flood-tide of chivalry. Knighthood was in the pod.
</p>

<p>
The sun was slowly setting in the east, rising and falling occasionally as it
subsided, and illuminating with its dying beams the towers of the grim castle
of Buggensberg.
</p>

<p>
Isolde the Slender stood upon an embattled turret of the castle. Her arms were
outstretched to the empty air, and her face, upturned as if in colloquy with
heaven, was distraught with yearning.
</p>

<p>
Anon she murmured, &ldquo;Guido&rdquo;&mdash;and bewhiles a deep sigh rent her
breast.
</p>

<p>
Sylph-like and ethereal in her beauty, she scarcely seemed to breathe.
</p>

<p>
In fact she hardly did.
</p>

<p>
Willowy and slender in form, she was as graceful as a meridian of longitude.
Her body seemed almost too frail for motion, while her features were of a mould
so delicate as to preclude all thought of intellectual operation.
</p>

<p>
She was begirt with a flowing kirtle of deep blue, bebound with a belt
bebuckled with a silvern clasp, while about her waist a stomacher of point lace
ended in the ruffled farthingale at her throat. On her head she bore a
sugar-loaf hat shaped like an extinguisher and pointing backward at an angle of
45 degrees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Guido,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;Guido.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And erstwhile she would wring her hands as one distraught and mutter, &ldquo;He
cometh not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sun sank and night fell, enwrapping in shadow the frowning castle of
Buggensberg, and the ancient city of Ghent at its foot. And as the darkness
gathered, the windows of the castle shone out with fiery red, for it was
Yuletide, and it was wassail all in the Great Hall of the castle, and this
night the Margrave of Buggensberg made him a feast, and celebrated the
betrothal of Isolde, his daughter, with Tancred the Tenspot.
</p>

<p>
And to the feast he had bidden all his liege lords and vassals&mdash; Hubert
the Husky, Edward the Earwig, Rollo the Rumbottle, and many others.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the Lady Isolde stood upon the battlements and mourned for the
absent Guido.
</p>

<p>
The love of Guido and Isolde was of that pure and almost divine type, found
only in the middle ages.
</p>

<p>
They had never seen one another. Guido had never seen Isolde, Isolde had never
seen Guido. They had never heard one another speak. They had never been
together. They did not know one another.
</p>

<p>
Yet they loved.
</p>

<p>
Their love had sprung into being suddenly and romantically, with all the mystic
charm which is love&rsquo;s greatest happiness.
</p>

<p>
Years before, Guido had seen the name of Isolde the Slender painted on a fence.
</p>

<p>
He had turned pale, fallen into a swoon and started at once for Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
On the very same day Isolde in passing through the streets of Ghent had seen
the coat of arms of Guido hanging on a clothes line.
</p>

<p>
She had fallen back into the arms of her tire-women more dead than alive.
</p>

<p>
Since that day they had loved.
</p>

<p>
Isolde would wander forth from the castle at earliest morn, with the name of
Guido on her lips. She told his name to the trees. She whispered it to the
flowers. She breathed it to the birds. Quite a lot of them knew it. At times
she would ride her palfrey along the sands of the sea and call
&ldquo;Guido&rdquo; to the waves! At other times she would tell it to the grass
or even to a stick of cordwood or a ton of coal.
</p>

<p>
Guido and Isolde, though they had never met, cherished each the features of the
other. Beneath his coat of mail Guido carried a miniature of Isolde, carven on
ivory. He had found it at the bottom of the castle crag, between the castle and
the old town of Ghent at its foot.
</p>

<p>
How did he know that it was Isolde?
</p>

<p>
There was no need for him to ask.
</p>

<p>
His <i>heart</i> had spoken.
</p>

<p>
The eye of love cannot be deceived.
</p>

<p>
And Isolde? She, too, cherished beneath her stomacher a miniature of Guido the
Gimlet. She had it of a travelling chapman in whose pack she had discovered it,
and had paid its price in pearls. How had she known that he it was, that is,
that it was he? Because of the Coat of Arms emblazoned beneath the miniature.
The same heraldic design that had first shaken her to the heart. Sleeping or
waking it was ever before her eyes: A lion, proper, quartered in a field of
gules, and a dog, improper, three-quarters in a field of buckwheat.
</p>

<p>
And if the love of Isolde burned thus purely for Guido, the love of Guido
burned for Isolde with a flame no less pure.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had love entered Guido&rsquo;s heart than he had determined to do
some great feat of emprise or adventure, some high achievement of deringdo
which should make him worthy to woo her.
</p>

<p>
He placed himself under a vow that he would eat nothing, save only food, and
drink nothing, save only liquor, till such season as he should have performed
his feat.
</p>

<p>
For this cause he had at once set out for Jerusalem to kill a Saracen for her.
He killed one, quite a large one. Still under his vow, he set out again at once
to the very confines of Pannonia determined to kill a Turk for her. From
Pannonia he passed into the Highlands of Britain, where he killed her a
Caledonian.
</p>

<p>
Every year and every month Guido performed for Isolde some new achievement of
emprise.
</p>

<p>
And in the meantime Isolde waited.
</p>

<p>
It was not that suitors were lacking. Isolde the Slender had suitors in plenty
ready to do her lightest hest.
</p>

<p>
Feats of arms were done daily for her sake. To win her love suitors were
willing to vow themselves to perdition. For Isolde&rsquo;s sake, Otto the Otter
had cast himself into the sea. Conrad the Cocoanut had hurled himself from the
highest battlement of the castle head first into the mud. Hugo the Hopeless had
hanged himself by the waistband to a hickory tree and had refused all efforts
to dislodge him. For her sake Sickfried the Susceptible had swallowed sulphuric
acid.
</p>

<p class="caption">Hugo the Hopeless had hanged himself</p>
</div>

<p>
But Isolde the Slender was heedless of the court thus paid to her.
</p>

<p>
In vain her stepmother, Agatha the Angular, urged her to marry. In vain her
father, the Margrave of Buggensberg, commanded her to choose the one or the
other of the suitors.
</p>

<p>
Her heart remained unswervingly true to the Gimlet.
</p>

<p>
From time to time love tokens passed between the lovers. From Jerusalem Guido
had sent to her a stick with a notch in it to signify his undying constancy.
From Pannonia he sent a piece of board, and from Venetia about two feet of
scantling. All these Isolde treasured. At night they lay beneath her pillow.
</p>

<p>
Then, after years of wandering, Guido had determined to crown his love with a
final achievement for Isolde&rsquo;s sake.
</p>

<p>
It was his design to return to Ghent, to scale by night the castle cliff and to
prove his love for Isolde by killing her father for her, casting her stepmother
from the battlements, burning the castle, and carrying her away.
</p>

<p>
This design he was now hastening to put into execution. Attended by fifty
trusty followers under the lead of Carlo the Corkscrew and Beowulf the Bradawl,
he had made his way to Ghent. Under cover of night they had reached the foot of
the castle cliff; and now, on their hands and knees in single file, they were
crawling round and round the spiral path that led up to the gate of the
fortress. At six of the clock they had spiralled once. At seven of the clock
they had reappeared at the second round, and as the feast in the hall reached
its height, they reappeared on the fourth lap.
</p>

<p>
Guido the Gimlet was in the lead. His coat of mail was hidden beneath a
parti-coloured cloak and he bore in his hand a horn.
</p>

<p>
By arrangement he was to penetrate into the castle by the postern gate in
disguise, steal from the Margrave by artifice the key of the great door, and
then by a blast of his horn summon his followers to the assault. Alas! there
was need for haste, for at this very Yuletide, on this very night, the
Margrave, wearied of Isolde&rsquo;s resistance, had determined to bestow her
hand upon Tancred the Tenspot.
</p>

<p>
It was wassail all in the great hall. The huge Margrave, seated at the head of
the board, drained flagon after flagon of wine, and pledged deep the health of
Tancred the Tenspot, who sat plumed and armoured beside him.
</p>

<p>
Great was the merriment of the Margrave, for beside him, crouched upon the
floor, was a new jester, whom the seneschal had just admitted by the postern
gate, and the novelty of whose jests made the huge sides of the Margrave shake
and shake again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Odds Bodikins!&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;but the tale is as rare as it is
new! and so the wagoner said to the Pilgrim that sith he had asked him to put
him off the wagon at that town, put him off he must, albeit it was but the
small of the night&mdash;by St. Pancras! whence hath the fellow so novel a
tale?&mdash;nay, tell it me but once more, haply I may remember
it&rdquo;&mdash;and the Baron fell back in a perfect paroxysm of merriment.
</p>

<p>
As he fell back, Guido&mdash;for the disguised jester was none other than he,
that is, than him&mdash;sprang forward and seized from the girdle of the
Margrave the key of the great door that dangled at his waist.
</p>

<p>
Then, casting aside the jester&rsquo;s cloak and cap, he rose to his full
height, standing in his coat of mail.
</p>

<p>
In one hand he brandished the double-headed mace of the Crusader, and in the
other a horn.
</p>

<p>
The guests sprang to their feet, their hands upon their daggers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Guido the Gimlet!&rdquo; they cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; said Guido, &ldquo;I have you in my power!!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then placing the horn to his lips and drawing a deep breath, he blew with his
utmost force.
</p>

<p>
And then again he blew&mdash;blew like anything.
</p>

<p>
Not a sound came.
</p>

<p>
The horn wouldn&rsquo;t blow!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seize him!&rdquo; cried the Baron.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Guido, &ldquo;I claim the laws of chivalry. I am here
to seek the Lady Isolde, betrothed by you to Tancred. Let me fight Tancred in
single combat, man to man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A shout of approbation gave consent.
</p>

<p>
The combat that followed was terrific.
</p>

<p>
First Guido, raising his mace high in the air with both hands, brought it down
with terrible force on Tancred&rsquo;s mailed head. Then Guido stood still, and
Tancred raising his mace in the air brought it down upon Guido&rsquo;s head.
Then Tancred stood still and turned his back, and Guido, swinging his mace
sideways, gave him a terrific blow from behind, midway, right centre. Tancred
returned the blow. Then Tancred knelt down on his hands and knees and Guido
brought the mace down on his back. It was a sheer contest of skill and agility.
For a time the issue was doubtful. Then Tancred&rsquo;s armour began to bend,
his blows weakened, he fell prone. Guido pressed his advantage and hammered him
out as flat as a sardine can. Then placing his foot on Tancred&rsquo;s chest,
he lowered his vizor and looked around about him.
</p>

<p>
At this second there was a resounding shriek.
</p>

<p>
Isolde the Slender, alarmed by the sound of the blows, precipitated herself
into the room.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the lovers looked into each other&rsquo;s faces.
</p>

<p>
Then with their countenances distraught with agony they fell swooning in
different directions.
</p>

<p>
There had been a mistake!
</p>

<p>
Guido was not Guido, and Isolde was not Isolde. They were wrong about the
miniatures. Each of them was a picture of somebody else.
</p>

<p>
Torrents of remorse flooded over the lovers&rsquo; hearts.
</p>

<p>
Isolde thought of the unhappy Tancred, hammered out as flat as a picture-card
and hopelessly spoilt; of Conrad the Cocoanut head first in the mud, and
Sickfried the Susceptible coiled up with agonies of sulphuric acid.
</p>

<p>
Guido thought of the dead Saracens and the slaughtered Turks.
</p>

<p>
And all for nothing!
</p>

<p>
The guerdon of their love had proved vain. Each of them was not what the other
had thought. So it is ever with the loves of this world, and herein is the
medieval allegory of this tale.
</p>

<p>
The hearts of the two lovers broke together.
</p>

<p>
They expired.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Carlo the Corkscrew and Beowulf the Bradawl, and their forty
followers, were hustling down the spirals as fast as they could crawl, hind end
uppermost.

Gertrude the Governess:<br />
or, Simple Seventeen</h2>

<p class="center">
<i>Synopsis of Previous Chapters:</i><br />
<i>There are no Previous Chapters.</i>
</p>

<p>
It was a wild and stormy night on the West Coast of Scotland. This, however, is
immaterial to the present story, as the scene is not laid in the West of
Scotland. For the matter of that the weather was just as bad on the East Coast
of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
But the scene of this narrative is laid in the South of England and takes place
in and around Knotacentinum Towers (pronounced as if written Nosham Taws), the
seat of Lord Knotacent (pronounced as if written Nosh).
</p>

<p>
But it is not necessary to pronounce either of these names in reading them.
</p>

<p>
Nosham Taws was a typical English home. The main part of the house was an
Elizabethan structure of warm red brick, while the elder portion, of which the
Earl was inordinately proud, still showed the outlines of a Norman Keep, to
which had been added a Lancastrian Jail and a Plantagenet Orphan Asylum. From
the house in all directions stretched magnificent woodland and park with oaks
and elms of immemorial antiquity, while nearer the house stood raspberry bushes
and geranium plants which had been set out by the Crusaders.
</p>

<p>
About the grand old mansion the air was loud with the chirping of thrushes, the
cawing of partridges and the clear sweet note of the rook, while deer, antelope
and other quadrupeds strutted about the lawn so tame as to eat off the
sun-dial. In fact, the place was a regular menagerie.
</p>

<p>
From the house downwards through the park stretched a beautiful broad avenue
laid out by Henry VII.
</p>

<p>
Lord Nosh stood upon the hearthrug of the library. Trained diplomat and
statesman as he was, his stern aristocratic face was upside down with fury.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you shall marry this girl or I disinherit
you. You are no son of mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Young Lord Ronald, erect before him, flung back a glance as defiant as his own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I defy you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Henceforth you are no father of mine.
I will get another. I will marry none but a woman I can love. This girl that we
have never seen&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus04"></a>
<a href="images/image04.jpg">
<img src="images/image04.jpg" width="358" height="500" alt="Illustration:" /></a>
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Henceforth you are no father of mine. I will get
another.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;would you throw aside our estate and
name of a thousand years? The girl, I am told, is beautiful; her aunt is
willing; they are French; pah! they understand such things in France.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But your reason&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I give no reason,&rdquo; said the Earl. &ldquo;Listen, Ronald, I give
one month. For that time you remain here. If at the end of it you refuse me, I
cut you off with a shilling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lord Ronald said nothing; he flung himself from the room, flung himself upon
his horse and rode madly off in all directions.
</p>

<p>
As the door of the library closed upon Ronald the Earl sank into a chair. His
face changed. It was no longer that of the haughty nobleman, but of the hunted
criminal. &ldquo;He must marry the girl,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Soon she
will know all. Tutchemoff has escaped from Siberia. He knows and will tell. The
whole of the mines pass to her, this property with it, and I&mdash;but
enough.&rdquo; He rose, walked to the sideboard, drained a dipper full of gin
and bitters, and became again a high-bred English gentleman.
</p>

<p>
It was at this moment that a high dogcart, driven by a groom in the livery of
Earl Nosh, might have been seen entering the avenue of Nosham Taws. Beside him
sat a young girl, scarce more than a child, in fact not nearly so big as the
groom.
</p>

<p>
The apple-pie hat which she wore, surmounted with black willow plumes,
concealed from view a face so face-like in its appearance as to be positively
facial.
</p>

<p>
It was&mdash;need we say it&mdash;Gertrude the Governess, who was this day to
enter upon her duties at Nosham Taws.
</p>

<p>
At the same time that the dogcart entered the avenue at one end there might
have been seen riding down it from the other a tall young man, whose long,
aristocratic face proclaimed his birth and who was mounted upon a horse with a
face even longer than his own.
</p>

<p>
And who is this tall young man who draws nearer to Gertrude with every
revolution of the horse? Ah, who, indeed? Ah, who, who? I wonder if any of my
readers could guess that this was none other than Lord Ronald.
</p>

<p>
The two were destined to meet. Nearer and nearer they came. And then still
nearer. Then for one brief moment they met. As they passed Gertrude raised her
head and directed towards the young nobleman two eyes so eye-like in their
expression as to be absolutely circular, while Lord Ronald directed towards the
occupant of the dogcart a gaze so gaze-like that nothing but a gazelle, or a
gas-pipe, could have emulated its intensity.
</p>

<p>
Was this the dawn of love? Wait and see. Do not spoil the story.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Let us speak of Gertrude. Gertrude DeMongmorenci McFiggin had known neither
father nor mother. They had both died years before she was born. Of her mother
she knew nothing, save that she was French, was extremely beautiful, and that
all her ancestors and even her business acquaintances had perished in the
Revolution.
</p>

<p>
Yet Gertrude cherished the memory of her parents. On her breast the girl wore a
locket in which was enshrined a miniature of her mother, while down her neck
inside at the back hung a daguerreotype of her father. She carried a portrait
of her grandmother up her sleeve and had pictures of her cousins tucked inside
her boot, while beneath her&mdash; but enough, quite enough.
</p>

<p>
Of her father Gertrude knew even less. That he was a high-born English
gentleman who had lived as a wanderer in many lands, this was all she knew. His
only legacy to Gertrude had been a Russian grammar, a Roumanian phrase-book, a
theodolite, and a work on mining engineering.
</p>

<p>
From her earliest infancy Gertrude had been brought up by her aunt. Her aunt
had carefully instructed her in Christian principles. She had also taught her
Mohammedanism to make sure.
</p>

<p>
When Gertrude was seventeen her aunt had died of hydrophobia.
</p>

<p>
The circumstances were mysterious. There had called upon her that day a strange
bearded man in the costume of the Russians. After he had left, Gertrude had
found her aunt in a syncope from which she passed into an apostrophe and never
recovered.
</p>

<p>
To avoid scandal it was called hydrophobia. Gertrude was thus thrown upon the
world. What to do? That was the problem that confronted her.
</p>

<p>
It was while musing one day upon her fate that Gertrude&rsquo;s eye was struck
with an advertisement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wanted a governess; must possess a knowledge of French, Italian,
Russian, and Roumanian, Music, and Mining Engineering. Salary £1, 4 shillings
and 4 pence halfpenny per annum. Apply between half-past eleven and twenty-five
minutes to twelve at No. 41 A Decimal Six, Belgravia Terrace. The Countess of
Nosh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gertrude was a girl of great natural quickness of apprehension, and she had not
pondered over this announcement more than half an hour before she was struck
with the extraordinary coincidence between the list of items desired and the
things that she herself knew.
</p>

<p>
She duly presented herself at Belgravia Terrace before the Countess, who
advanced to meet her with a charm which at once placed the girl at her ease.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are proficient in French,&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Oh, oui,&rdquo;</i> said Gertrude modestly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Italian,&rdquo; continued the Countess.
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Oh, si,&rdquo;</i> said Gertrude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And German,&rdquo; said the Countess in delight.
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Ah, ja,&rdquo;</i> said Gertrude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Russian?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Yaw.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Roumanian?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>&ldquo;Jep.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
Amazed at the girl&rsquo;s extraordinary proficiency in modern languages, the
Countess looked at her narrowly. Where had she seen those lineaments before?
She passed her hand over her brow in thought, and spit upon the floor, but no,
the face baffled her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I engage you on the spot; to-morrow you
go down to Nosham Taws and begin teaching the children. I must add that in
addition you will be expected to aid the Earl with his Russian correspondence.
He has large mining interests at Tschminsk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tschminsk! why did the simple word reverberate upon Gertrude&rsquo;s ears? Why?
Because it was the name written in her father&rsquo;s hand on the title page of
his book on mining. What mystery was here?
</p>

<p>
It was on the following day that Gertrude had driven up the avenue.
</p>

<p>
She descended from the dogcart, passed through a phalanx of liveried servants
drawn up seven-deep, to each of whom she gave a sovereign as she passed and
entered Nosham Taws.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; said the Countess, as she aided Gertrude to carry her
trunk upstairs.
</p>

<p>
The girl presently descended and was ushered into the library, where she was
presented to the Earl. As soon as the Earl&rsquo;s eye fell upon the face of
the new governess he started visibly. Where had he seen those lineaments? Where
was it? At the races, or the theatre&mdash;on a bus&mdash;no. Some subtler
thread of memory was stirring in his mind. He strode hastily to the sideboard,
drained a dipper and a half of brandy, and became again the perfect English
gentleman.
</p>

<p>
While Gertrude has gone to the nursery to make the acquaintance of the two tiny
golden-haired children who are to be her charges, let us say something here of
the Earl and his son.
</p>

<p>
Lord Nosh was the perfect type of the English nobleman and statesman. The years
that he had spent in the diplomatic service at Constantinople, St. Petersburg,
and Salt Lake City had given to him a peculiar finesse and noblesse, while his
long residence at St. Helena, Pitcairn Island, and Hamilton, Ontario, had
rendered him impervious to external impressions. As deputy-paymaster of the
militia of the county he had seen something of the sterner side of military
life, while his hereditary office of Groom of the Sunday Breeches had brought
him into direct contact with Royalty itself.
</p>

<p>
His passion for outdoor sports endeared him to his tenants. A keen sportsman,
he excelled in fox-hunting, dog-hunting, pig-killing, bat-catching and the
pastimes of his class.
</p>

<p>
In this latter respect Lord Ronald took after his father. From the start the
lad had shown the greatest promise. At Eton he had made a splendid showing at
battledore and shuttlecock, and at Cambridge had been first in his class at
needlework. Already his name was whispered in connection with the All-England
ping-pong championship, a triumph which would undoubtedly carry with it a seat
in Parliament.
</p>

<p>
Thus was Gertrude the Governess installed at Nosham Taws.
</p>

<p>
The days and the weeks sped past.
</p>

<p>
The simple charm of the beautiful orphan girl attracted all hearts. Her two
little pupils became her slaves. &ldquo;Me loves oo,&rdquo; the little
Rasehellfrida would say, leaning her golden head in Gertrude&rsquo;s lap. Even
the servants loved her. The head gardener would bring a bouquet of beautiful
roses to her room before she was up, the second gardener a bunch of early
cauliflowers, the third a spray of late asparagus, and even the tenth and
eleventh a sprig of mangel-wurzel of an armful of hay. Her room was full of
gardeners all the time, while at evening the aged butler, touched at the
friendless girl&rsquo;s loneliness, would tap softly at her door to bring her a
rye whiskey and seltzer or a box of Pittsburg Stogies. Even the dumb creatures
seemed to admire her in their own dumb way. The dumb rooks settled on her
shoulder and every dumb dog around the place followed her.
</p>

<p>
And Ronald! ah, Ronald! Yes, indeed! They had met. They had spoken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a dull morning,&rdquo; Gertrude had said. <i>&ldquo;Quelle triste
matin! Was fur ein allerverdamnter Tag!&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beastly,&rdquo; Ronald had answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beastly!!&rdquo; The word rang in Gertrude&rsquo;s ears all day.
</p>

<p>
After that they were constantly together. They played tennis and ping-pong in
the day, and in the evening, in accordance with the stiff routine of the place,
they sat down with the Earl and Countess to twenty-five-cent poker, and later
still they sat together on the verandah and watched the moon sweeping in great
circles around the horizon.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before Gertrude realised that Lord Ronald felt towards her a
warmer feeling than that of mere ping-pong. At times in her presence he would
fall, especially after dinner, into a fit of profound subtraction.
</p>

<p>
Once at night, when Gertrude withdrew to her chamber and before seeking her
pillow, prepared to retire as a preliminary to disrobing&mdash;in other words,
before going to bed, she flung wide the casement (opened the window) and
perceived (saw) the face of Lord Ronald. He was sitting on a thorn bush beneath
her, and his upturned face wore an expression of agonised pallor.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the days passed. Life at the Taws moved in the ordinary routine of a
great English household. At 7 a gong sounded for rising, at 8 a horn blew for
breakfast, at 8.30 a whistle sounded for prayers, at 1 a flag was run up at
half-mast for lunch, at 4 a gun was fired for afternoon tea, at 9 a first bell
sounded for dressing, at 9.15 a second bell for going on dressing, while at
9.30 a rocket was sent up to indicate that dinner was ready. At midnight dinner
was over, and at 1 a.m. the tolling of a bell summoned the domestics to evening
prayers.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the month allotted by the Earl to Lord Ronald was passing away. It
was already July 15, then within a day or two it was July 17, and, almost
immediately afterwards, July 18.
</p>

<p>
At times the Earl, in passing Ronald in the hall, would say sternly,
&ldquo;Remember, boy, your consent, or I disinherit you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And what were the Earl&rsquo;s thoughts of Gertrude? Here was the one drop of
bitterness in the girl&rsquo;s cup of happiness. For some reason that she could
not divine the Earl showed signs of marked antipathy.
</p>

<p>
Once as she passed the door of the library he threw a bootjack at her. On
another occasion at lunch alone with her he struck her savagely across the face
with a sausage.
</p>

<p>
It was her duty to translate to the Earl his Russian correspondence. She sought
in it in vain for the mystery. One day a Russian telegram was handed to the
Earl. Gertrude translated it to him aloud.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tutchemoff went to the woman. She is dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On hearing this the Earl became livid with fury, in fact this was the day that
he struck her with the sausage.
</p>

<p>
Then one day while the Earl was absent on a bat hunt, Gertrude, who was turning
over his correspondence, with that sweet feminine instinct of interest that
rose superior to ill-treatment, suddenly found the key to the mystery.
</p>

<p>
Lord Nosh was not the rightful owner of the Taws. His distant cousin of the
older line, the true heir, had died in a Russian prison to which the
machinations of the Earl, while Ambassador at Tschminsk, had consigned him. The
daughter of this cousin was the true owner of Nosham Taws.
</p>

<p>
The family story, save only that the documents before her withheld the name of
the rightful heir, lay bare to Gertrude&rsquo;s eye.
</p>

<p>
Strange is the heart of woman. Did Gertrude turn from the Earl with spurning?
No. Her own sad fate had taught her sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Yet still the mystery remained! Why did the Earl start perceptibly each time
that he looked into her face? Sometimes he started as much as four centimetres,
so that one could distinctly see him do it. On such occasions he would hastily
drain a dipper of rum and vichy water and become again the correct English
gentleman.
</p>

<p>
The denouement came swiftly. Gertrude never forgot it.
</p>

<p>
It was the night of the great ball at Nosham Taws. The whole neighbourhood was
invited. How Gertrude&rsquo;s heart had beat with anticipation, and with what
trepidation she had overhauled her scant wardrobe in order to appear not
unworthy in Lord Ronald&rsquo;s eyes. Her resources were poor indeed, yet the
inborn genius for dress that she inherited from her French mother stood her in
good stead. She twined a single rose in her hair and contrived herself a dress
out of a few old newspapers and the inside of an umbrella that would have
graced a court. Round her waist she bound a single braid of bagstring, while a
piece of old lace that had been her mother&rsquo;s was suspended to her ear by
a thread.
</p>

<p>
Gertrude was the cynosure of all eyes. Floating to the strains of the music she
presented a picture of bright girlish innocence that no one could see
undisenraptured.
</p>

<p>
The ball was at its height. It was away up!
</p>

<p>
Ronald stood with Gertrude in the shrubbery. They looked into one
another&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gertrude,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Simple words, and yet they thrilled every fibre in the girl&rsquo;s costume.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ronald!&rdquo; she said, and cast herself about his neck.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the Earl appeared standing beside them in the moonlight. His
stern face was distorted with indignation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said, turning to Ronald, &ldquo;it appears that you have
chosen!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Ronald with hauteur.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You prefer to marry this penniless girl rather than the heiress I have
selected for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gertrude looked from father to son in amazement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ronald.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the Earl, draining a dipper of gin which he
carried, and resuming his calm. &ldquo;Then I disinherit you. Leave this place,
and never return to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, Gertrude,&rdquo; said Ronald tenderly, &ldquo;let us flee
together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gertrude stood before them. The rose had fallen from her head. The lace had
fallen from her ear and the bagstring had come undone from her waist. Her
newspapers were crumpled beyond recognition. But dishevelled and illegible as
she was, she was still mistress of herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;Ronald, you shall never make this
sacrifice for me.&rdquo; Then to the Earl, in tones of ice, &ldquo;There is a
pride, sir, as great even as yours. The daughter of Metschnikoff McFiggin need
crave a boon from no one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With that she hauled from her bosom the daguerreotype of her father and pressed
it to her lips.
</p>

<p>
The earl started as if shot. &ldquo;That name!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that
face! that photograph! stop!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There! There is no need to finish; my readers have long since divined it.
Gertrude was the heiress.
</p>

<p>
The lovers fell into one another&rsquo;s arms. The Earl&rsquo;s proud face
relaxed. &ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; he said. The Countess and the guests came
pouring out upon the lawn. The breaking day illuminated a scene of gay
congratulations.
</p>

<p>
Gertrude and Ronald were wed. Their happiness was complete. Need we say more?
Yes, only this. The Earl was killed in the hunting-field a few days after. The
Countess was struck by lightning. The two children fell down a well. Thus the
happiness of Gertrude and Ronald was complete.

<h2><a name="chap05"></a>V.<br />
A Hero in Homespun:<br />
or, The Life Struggle of Hezekiah Hayloft</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you give me a job?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The foreman of the bricklayers looked down from the scaffold to the speaker
below. Something in the lad&rsquo;s upturned face appealed to the man. He threw
a brick at him.
</p>

<p>
It was Hezekiah Hayloft. He was all in homespun. He carried a carpet-bag in
each hand. He had come to New York, the cruel city, looking for work.
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah moved on. Presently he stopped in front of a policeman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can you tell me the way to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The policeman struck him savagely across the side of the head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll learn you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to ask damn fool
questions&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Hezekiah moved on. In a few moments he met a man whose tall black hat,
black waistcoat and white tie proclaimed him a clergyman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good sir,&rdquo; said Hezekiah, &ldquo;can you tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The clergyman pounced upon him with a growl of a hyena, and bit a piece out of
his ear. Yes, he did, reader. Just imagine a clergyman biting a boy in open
daylight! Yet that happens in New York every minute.
</p>

<p>
Such is the great cruel city, and imagine looking for work in it. You and I who
spend our time in trying to avoid work can hardly realise what it must mean.
Think how it must feel to be alone in New York, without a friend or a relation
at hand, with no one to know or care what you do. It must be great!
</p>

<p>
For a few moments Hezekiah stood irresolute. He looked about him. He looked up
at the top of the Metropolitan Tower. He saw no work there. He looked across at
the skyscrapers on Madison Square, but his eye detected no work in any of them.
He stood on his head and looked up at the flat-iron building. Still no work in
sight.
</p>

<p>
All that day and the next Hezekiah looked for work.
</p>

<p>
A Wall Street firm had advertised for a stenographer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you write shorthand?&rdquo; they said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the boy in homespun, &ldquo;but I can try.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They threw him down the elevator.
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah was not discouraged. That day he applied for fourteen jobs.
</p>

<p>
The Waldorf Astoria was in need of a chef. Hezekiah applied for the place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you cook?&rdquo; they said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hezekiah, &ldquo;but oh, sir, give me a trial, give me
an egg and let me try&mdash;I will try so hard.&rdquo; Great tears rolled down
the boy&rsquo;s face.
</p>

<p>
They rolled him out into the corridor.
</p>

<p>
Next he applied for a job as a telegrapher. His mere ignorance of telegraphy
was made the ground of refusal.
</p>

<p>
At nightfall Hezekiah Hayloft grew hungry. He entered again the portico of the
Waldorf Astoria. Within it stood a tall man in uniform.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; said the boy hero, &ldquo;will you trust me for the price
of a square meal?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They set the dog on him.
</p>

<p>
Such, reader, is the hardness and bitterness of the Great City.
</p>

<p>
For fourteen weeks Hezekiah Hayloft looked for work. Once or twice he obtained
temporary employment only to lose it again.
</p>

<p>
For a few days he was made accountant in a trust company. He was discharged
because he would not tell a lie. For about a week he held a position as cashier
in a bank. They discharged the lad because he refused to forge a cheque. For
three days he held a conductorship on a Broadway surface car. He was dismissed
from this business for refusing to steal a nickel.
</p>

<p>
Such, reader, is the horrid degradation of business life in New York.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the days passed and still Hayloft found no work. His stock of money
was exhausted. He had not had any money anyway. For food he ate grass in
Central Park and drank the water from the Cruelty to Animals horse-trough.
</p>

<p>
Gradually a change came over the lad; his face grew hard and stern, the great
city was setting its mark upon him.
</p>

<p>
One night Hezekiah stood upon the sidewalk. It was late, long after ten
o&rsquo;clock. Only a few chance pedestrians passed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; said Hezekiah, shaking his fist at the lights of the
cruel city, &ldquo;I have exhausted fair means, I will try foul. I will beg. No
Hayloft has been a beggar yet,&rdquo; he added with a bitter laugh, &ldquo;but
I will begin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A well-dressed man passed along.
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah seized him by the throat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; cried the man in sudden terror.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me for work. I tell you I have no work to give.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want work,&rdquo; said Hezekiah grimly. &ldquo;I am a
beggar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! is that all,&rdquo; said the man, relieved. &ldquo;Here, take this
ten dollars and go and buy a drink with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Money! money! and with it a new sense of power that rushed like an intoxicant
to Hezekiah&rsquo;s brain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely, &ldquo;yes, drink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lights of a soda-water fountain struck his eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me an egg phosphate,&rdquo; he said as he dashed his money on the
counter. He drank phosphate after phosphate till his brain reeled. Mad with the
liquor, he staggered to and fro in the shop, weighed himself recklessly on the
slot machine three or four times, tore out chewing gum and matches from the
automatic nickel boxes, and finally staggered on to the street, reeling from
the effects of thirteen phosphates and a sarsaparilla soda.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Crime,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Crime, crime, that&rsquo;s what I
want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He noticed that the passers-by made way for him now with respect. On the corner
of the street a policeman was standing.
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah picked up a cobblestone, threw it, and struck the man full on the ear.
</p>

<p>
The policeman smiled at him roguishly, and then gently wagged his finger in
reproof. It was the same policeman who had struck him fourteen weeks before for
asking the way.
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah moved on, still full of his new idea of crime. Down the street was a
novelty shop, the window decked with New Year&rsquo;s gifts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sell me a revolver,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the salesman. &ldquo;Would you like something for
evening wear, or a plain kind for home use. Here is a very good family
revolver, or would you like a roof garden size?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah selected a revolver and went out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I will burglarise a house and get
money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Walking across to Fifth Avenue he selected one of the finest residences and
rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
A man in livery appeared in the brightly lighted hall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is your master?&rdquo; Hezekiah asked, showing his revolver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is upstairs, sir, counting his money,&rdquo; the man answered,
&ldquo;but he dislikes being disturbed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Show me to him,&rdquo; said Hezekiah, &ldquo;I wish to shoot him and
take his money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; said the man deferentially. &ldquo;You will find
him on the first floor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah turned and shot the footman twice through the livery and went
upstairs.
</p>

<p class="caption">Hezekiah shot the footman twice through the livery</p>
</div>

<p>
In an upper room was a man sitting at a desk under a reading-lamp. In front of
him was a pile of gold.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; said Hezekiah.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am counting my money,&rdquo; said the man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; asked Hezekiah sternly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am a philanthropist,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I give my money to
deserving objects. I establish medals for heroes. I give prizes for ship
captains who jump into the sea, and for firemen who throw people from the
windows of upper stories at the risk of their own; I send American missionaries
to China, Chinese missionaries to India, and Indian missionaries to Chicago. I
set aside money to keep college professors from starving to death when they
deserve it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Hezekiah, &ldquo;you deserve to die. Stand up. Open
your mouth and shut your eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man stood up.
</p>

<p>
There was a loud report. The philanthropist fell. He was shot through the
waistcoat and his suspenders were cut to ribbons.
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah, his eyes glittering with the mania of crime, crammed his pockets with
gold pieces.
</p>

<p>
There was a roar and hubbub in the street below.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The police!&rdquo; Hezekiah muttered. &ldquo;I must set fire to the
house and escape in the confusion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He struck a safety match and held it to the leg of the table.
</p>

<p>
It was a fireproof table and refused to burn. He held it to the door. The door
was fireproof. He applied it to the bookcase. He ran the match along the books.
They were all fireproof. Everything was fireproof.
</p>

<p>
Frenzied with rage, he tore off his celluloid collar and set fire to it. He
waved it above his head. Great tongues of flame swept from the windows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; was the cry.
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah rushed to the door and threw the blazing collar down the elevator
shaft. In a moment the iron elevator, with its steel ropes, burst into a mass
of flame; then the brass fittings of the door took fire, and in a moment the
cement floor of the elevator was one roaring mass of flame. Great columns of
smoke burst from the building.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; shouted the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Reader, have you ever seen a fire in a great city? The sight is a wondrous one.
One realises that, vast and horrible as the city is, it nevertheless shows its
human organisation in its most perfect form.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had the fire broken out before resolute efforts were made to stay its
progress. Long lines of men passed buckets of water from hand to hand.
</p>

<p>
The water was dashed on the fronts of the neighbouring houses, thrown all over
the street, splashed against the telegraph poles, and poured in torrents over
the excited crowd. Every place in the neighbourhood of the fire was literally
soaked. The man worked with a will. A derrick rapidly erected in the street
reared itself to the height of sixteen or seventeen feet. A daring man mounted
on the top of it, hauled bucket after bucket of water on the pulley. Balancing
himself with the cool daring of the trained fireman, he threw the water in all
directions over the crowd.
</p>

<p>
The fire raged for an hour. Hezekiah, standing at an empty window amid the
flames, rapidly filled his revolver and emptied it into the crowd.
</p>

<p>
From one hundred revolvers in the street a fusillade was kept up in return.
</p>

<p>
This lasted for an hour. Several persons were almost hit by the rain of
bullets, which would have proved fatal had they struck anyone.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, as the flames died down, a squad of policemen rushed into the doomed
building.
</p>

<p>
Hezekiah threw aside his revolver and received them with folded arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hayloft,&rdquo; said the chief of police, &ldquo;I arrest you for
murder, burglary, arson, and conspiracy. You put up a splendid fight, old man,
and I am only sorry that it is our painful duty to arrest you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Hayloft appeared below a great cheer went up from the crowd. True courage
always appeals to the heart of the people.
</p>

<p>
Hayloft was put in a motor and whirled rapidly to the police station.
</p>

<p>
On the way the chief handed him a flask and a cigar.
</p>

<p>
They chatted over the events of the evening.
</p>

<p>
Hayloft realised that a new life had opened for him. He was no longer a
despised outcast. He had entered the American criminal class.
</p>

<p>
At the police station the chief showed Hezekiah to his room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you will like this room,&rdquo; he said a little anxiously.
&ldquo;It is the best that I can give you to-night. To-morrow I can give you a
room with a bath, but at such short notice I am sure you will not mind putting
up with this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said good night and shut the door. In a moment he reappeared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About breakfast?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would you rather have it in your
room, or will you join us at our table d&rsquo;hote? The force are most anxious
to meet you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Next morning, before Hezekiah was up, the chief brought to his room a new
outfit of clothes&mdash;a silk hat, frock-coat, shepherd&rsquo;s-plaid trousers
and varnished boots with spats.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind accepting these things, Mr. Hayloft. Our force
would like very much to enable you to make a suitable appearance in the
court.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Carefully dressed and shaved, Hezekiah descended. He was introduced to the
leading officials of the force, and spent a pleasant hour of chat over a cigar,
discussing the incidents of the night before.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the morning a number of persons called to meet and
congratulate Hezekiah.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to tell you, sir,&rdquo; said the editor of a great American
daily, &ldquo;that your work of last night will be known and commented on all
over the States. Your shooting of the footman was a splendid piece of nerve,
sir, and will do much in defence of the unwritten law.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hayloft,&rdquo; said another caller, &ldquo;I am sorry not to have
met you sooner. Our friends here tell me that you have been in New York for
some months. I regret, sir, that we did not know you. This is the name of my
firm, Mr. Hayloft. We are leading lawyers here, and we want the honour of
defending you. We may! Thank you, sir. And now, as we have still an hour or two
before the court, I want to run you up to my house in my motor. My wife is very
anxious to have a little luncheon with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The court met that afternoon. There was a cheer as Hezekiah entered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hayloft,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;I am adjourning this court
for a few days. From what I hear the nerve strain that you have undergone must
have been most severe. Your friends tell me that you can hardly be in a state
to take a proper interest in the case till you have had a thorough rest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Hayloft left the court a cheer went up from the crowd, in which the judge
joined.
</p>

<p>
The next few days were busy days for Hezekiah. Filled with receptions, civic
committees, and the preparation of the brief, in which Hezekiah&rsquo;s native
intelligence excited the admiration of the lawyers.
</p>

<p>
Newspaper men sought for interviews. Business promoters called upon Hezekiah.
His name was put down as a director of several leading companies, and it was
rumoured that in the event of his acquittal he would undertake a merger of all
the great burglar protection corporations of the United States.
</p>

<p>
The trial opened a week later, and lasted two months. Hezekiah was indicted on
five charges&mdash;arson, for having burned the steel cage of the elevator;
misdemeanour, for shooting the footman; the theft of the money, petty larceny;
the killing of the philanthropist, infanticide; and the shooting at the police
without hitting them, aggravated felony.
</p>

<p>
The proceedings were very complicated&mdash;expert evidence was taken from all
over the United States. An analytical examination was made of the brain of the
philanthropist. Nothing was found.
</p>

<p>
The entire jury were dismissed three times on the grounds of prejudice, twice
on the ground of ignorance, and finally disbanded on the ground of insanity.
</p>

<p>
The proceedings dragged on.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Hezekiah&rsquo;s business interests accumulated.
</p>

<p>
At length, at Hezekiah&rsquo;s own suggestion, it was necessary to abandon the
case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, in his final speech to the court, &ldquo;I
feel that I owe an apology for not being able to attend these proceedings any
further. At any time, when I can snatch an hour or two from my business, you
may always count on my attendance. In the meantime, rest assured that I shall
follow your proceedings with the greatest interest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He left the room amid three cheers and the singing of &ldquo;Auld Lang
Syne.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After that the case dragged hopeless on from stage to stage.
</p>

<p>
The charge of arson was met by a <i>nolle prosequi</i>. The accusation of theft
was stopped by a <i>ne plus ultra</i>. The killing of the footman was
pronounced justifiable insanity.
</p>

<p>
The accusation of murder for the death of the philanthropist was withdrawn by
common consent. Damages in error were awarded to Hayloft for the loss of his
revolver and cartridges. The main body of the case was carried on a writ of
<i>certiorari</i> to the Federal Courts and appealed to the Supreme Court of
the United States.
</p>

<p>
It is there still.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, Hezekiah, as managing director of the Burglars&rsquo; Security
Corporation, remains one of the rising generation of financiers in New York,
with every prospect of election to the State Senate.

Sorrows of a Super Soul:<br />
or, The Memoirs of Marie Mushenough</h2>

<p class="center">
<i>(Translated, by Machinery, out of the Original Russian.)</i>
</p>

<p>
Do you ever look at your face in the glass?
</p>

<p>
I do.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I stand for hours and peer at my face and wonder at it. At times I
turn it upside down and gaze intently at it. I try to think what it means. It
seems to look back at me with its great brown eyes as if it knew me and wanted
to speak to me.
</p>

<p>
Why was I born?
</p>

<p>
I do not know.
</p>

<p>
I ask my face a thousand times a day and find no answer.
</p>

<p>
At times when people pass my room&mdash;my maid Nitnitzka, or Jakub, the
serving-man&mdash;and see me talking to my face, they think I am foolish.
</p>

<p>
But I am not.
</p>

<p>
At times I cast myself on the sofa and bury my head in the cushions. Even then
I cannot find out why I was born.
</p>

<p>
I am seventeen.
</p>

<p>
Shall I ever be seventy-seven? Ah!
</p>

<p>
Shall I ever be even sixty-seven, or sixty-seven even? Oh!
</p>

<p>
And if I am both of these, shall I ever be eighty-seven?
</p>

<p>
I cannot tell.
</p>

<p>
Often I start up in the night with wild eyes and wonder if I shall be
eighty-seven.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Next Day.
</p>

<p>
I passed a flower in my walk to-day. It grew in the meadow beside the river
bank.
</p>

<p>
It stood dreaming on a long stem.
</p>

<p>
I knew its name. It was a Tchupvskja. I love beautiful names.
</p>

<p>
I leaned over and spoke to it. I asked it if my heart would ever know love. It
said it thought so.
</p>

<p>
On the way home I passed an onion.
</p>

<p>
It lay upon the road.
</p>

<p>
Someone had stepped upon its stem and crushed it. How it must have suffered. I
placed it in my bosom. All night it lay beside my pillow.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Another Day.
</p>

<p>
My heart is yearning for love! How is it that I can love no one?
</p>

<p>
I have tried and I cannot. My father&mdash;Ivan Ivanovitch&mdash;he is so big
and so kind, and yet I cannot love him; and my mother, Katoosha Katooshavitch,
she is just as big, and yet I cannot love her. And my brother, Dimitri
Dimitrivitch, I cannot love him.
</p>

<p>
And Alexis Alexovitch!
</p>

<p>
I cannot love him. And yet I am to marry him. They have set the day. It is a
month from to-day. One month. Thirty days. Why cannot I love Alexis? He is tall
and strong. He is a soldier. He is in the Guard of the Czar, Nicholas Romanoff,
and yet I cannot love him.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Next Day but one.
</p>

<p>
How they cramp and confine me here&mdash;Ivan Ivanovitch my father, and my
mother (I forget her name for the minute), and all the rest.
</p>

<p>
I cannot breathe.
</p>

<p>
They will not let me.
</p>

<p>
Every time I try to commit suicide they hinder me.
</p>

<p>
Last night I tried again.
</p>

<p>
I placed a phial of sulphuric acid on the table beside my bed.
</p>

<p>
In the morning it was still there.
</p>

<p>
It had not killed me.
</p>

<p>
They have forbidden me to drown myself.
</p>

<p>
Why!
</p>

<p>
I do not know why? In vain I ask the air and the trees why I should not drown
myself? They do not see any reason why.
</p>

<p>
And yet I long to be free, free as the young birds, as the very youngest of
them.
</p>

<p>
I watch the leaves blowing in the wind and I want to be a leaf.
</p>

<p>
Yet here they want to make me eat!
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I ate a banana! Ugh!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Next Day.
</p>

<p>
To-day in my walk I found a cabbage.
</p>

<p>
It lay in a corner of the hedge. Cruel boys had chased it there with stones.
</p>

<p>
It was dead when I lifted it up.
</p>

<p>
Beside it was an egg.
</p>

<p>
It too was dead. Ah, how I wept&mdash;
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
This Morning.
</p>

<p>
How my heart beats. To-day A MAN passed. He passed: actually passed.
</p>

<p>
From my window I saw him go by the garden gate and out into the meadow beside
the river where my Tchupvskja flower is growing!
</p>

<p>
How beautiful he looked! Not tall like Alexis Alexovitch, ah, no! but so short
and wide and round&mdash;shaped like the beautiful cabbage that died last week.
</p>

<p>
He wore a velvet jacket and he carried a camp stool and an easel on his back,
and in his face was a curved pipe with a long stem, and his face was not red
and rough like the face of Alexis, but mild and beautiful and with a smile that
played on it like moonlight over putty.
</p>

<p>
Do I love him? I cannot tell. Not yet. Love is a gentle plant. You cannot force
its growth.
</p>

<p>
As he passed I leaned from the window and threw a rosebud at him.
</p>

<p>
But he did not see it.
</p>

<p>
Then I threw a cake of soap and a toothbrush at him. But I missed him, and he
passed on.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Another Day.
</p>

<p>
Love has come into my life. It fills it. I have seen HIM again. I have spoken
with him. He sat beside the river on his camp stool. How beautiful he looked,
sitting on it: how strong he seemed and how frail the little stool on which he
sat.
</p>

<p>
Before him was the easel and he was painting. I spoke to him.
</p>

<p>
I know his name now.
</p>

<p>
His name&mdash;. How my heart beats as I write it&mdash;no, I cannot write it,
I will whisper it&mdash;it is Otto Dinkelspiel.
</p>

<p>
Is it not a beautiful name? Ah!
</p>

<p>
He was painting on a canvas&mdash;beautiful colours, red and gold and white, in
glorious opalescent streaks in all directions.
</p>

<p>
I looked at it in wonder.
</p>

<p>
Instinctively I spoke to him. &ldquo;What are you painting?&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Is it the Heavenly Child?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is a cow!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then I looked again and I could see that it was a cow.
</p>

<p>
I looked straight into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It shall be our secret,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;no one else shall
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And I knew that I loved him.

A Week Later.
</p>

<p>
Each morning I go to see Otto beside the river in the meadow.
</p>

<p>
He sits and paints, and I sit with my hands clasped about my knees and talk to
him. I tell him all that I think, all that I read, all that I know, all that I
feel, all that I do not feel.
</p>

<p>
He listens to me with that far-away look that I have learned to love and that
means that he is thinking deeply; at times he almost seems not to hear.
</p>

<p>
The intercourse of our minds is wonderful.
</p>

<p>
We stimulate one another&rsquo;s thought.
</p>

<p>
Otto is my master. I am his disciple!
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I asked him if Hegel or Schlegel or Whegel gives the truest view of
life.
</p>

<p>
He said he didn&rsquo;t know! My Otto!
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
To-day.
</p>

<p>
Otto touched me! He touched me!
</p>

<p>
How the recollection of it thrills me!
</p>

<p>
I stood beside him on the river bank, and as we talked the handle of my parasol
touched the bottom button of his waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to burn me like fire!
</p>

<p>
To-morrow I am to bring Otto to see my father.
</p>

<p>
But to-night I can think of nothing else but that Otto has touched me.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Next Day.
</p>

<p>
Otto has touched father! He touched him for ten roubles. My father is furious.
I cannot tell what it means.
</p>

<p>
I brought Otto to our home. He spoke with my father, Ivan Ivanovitch. They sat
together in the evening. And now my father is angry. He says that Otto wanted
to touch him.
</p>

<p>
Why should he be angry?
</p>

<p>
But Otto is forbidden the house, and I can see him only in the meadow.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Two Days Later.
</p>

<p>
To-day Otto asked me for a keepsake.
</p>

<p>
I offered him one of my hatpins. But he said no. He has taken instead the
diamond buckle from my belt.
</p>

<p>
I read his meaning.
</p>

<p>
He means that I am to him as a diamond is to lesser natures.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
This Morning.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday Otto asked me for another keepsake. I took a gold rouble from my bag
and said that he should break it in half and that each should keep one of the
halves.
</p>

<p>
But Otto said no. I divined his thought. It would violate our love to break the
coin.
</p>

<p>
He is to keep it for both of us, and it is to remain unbroken like our love.
</p>

<p>
Is it not a sweet thought?
</p>

<p>
Otto is so thoughtful. He thinks of everything.
</p>

<p>
To-day he asked me if I had another gold rouble.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Next Day.
</p>

<p>
To-day I brought Otto another gold rouble.
</p>

<p>
His eyes shone with love when he saw it.
</p>

<p>
He has given me for it a bronze kopek. Our love is to be as pure as gold and as
strong as bronze.
</p>

<p>
Is it not beautiful?
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Later.
</p>

<p>
I am so fearful that Alexis Alexovitch may return.
</p>

<p>
I fear that if he comes Otto might kill him. Otto is so calm, I dread to think
of what would happen if he were aroused.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Next Day.
</p>

<p>
I have told Otto about Alexis. I have told him that Alexis is a soldier, that
he is in the Guards of the Czar, and that I am betrothed to him. At first Otto
would not listen to me. He feared that his anger might overmaster him. He began
folding up his camp-stool.
</p>

<p>
Then I told him that Alexis would not come for some time yet, and he grew
calmer.
</p>

<p>
I have begged him for my sake not to kill Alexis. He has given me his promise.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Another Day.
</p>

<p>
Ivan Ivanovitch, my father, has heard from Alexis. He will return in fourteen
days. The day after his return I am to marry him.
</p>

<p>
And meantime I have still fourteen days to love Otto.
</p>

<p>
My love is perfect. It makes me want to die. Last night I tried again to commit
suicide. Why should I live now that I have known a perfect love? I placed a box
of cartridges beside my bed. I awoke unharmed. They did not kill me. But I know
what it means. It means that Otto and I are to die together. I must tell Otto.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Later.
</p>

<p>
To-day I told Otto that we must kill ourselves, that our love is so perfect
that we have no right to live.
</p>

<p>
At first he looked so strange.
</p>

<p>
He suggested that I should kill myself first and that he should starve himself
beside my grave.
</p>

<p>
But I could not accept the sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
I offered instead to help him to hang himself beside the river.
</p>

<p>
He is to think it over. If he does not hang himself, he is to shoot himself. I
have lent him my father&rsquo;s revolver. How grateful he looked when he took
it.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Next Day.
</p>

<p>
Why does Otto seem to avoid me? Has he some secret sorrow that I cannot share?
To-day he moved his camp-stool to the other side of the meadow. He was in the
long grass behind an elderberry bush. At first I did not see him. I thought
that he had hanged himself. But he said no. He had forgotten to get a rope. He
had tried, he said, to shoot himself. But he had missed himself.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Five Days Later.
</p>

<p>
Otto and I are not to die. We are to live; to live and love one another for
ever! We are going away, out into the world together! How happy I am!
</p>

<p>
Otto and I are to flee together.
</p>

<p>
When Alexis comes we shall be gone; we shall be far away.
</p>

<p>
I have said to Otto that I will fly with him, and he has said yes.
</p>

<p>
I told him that we would go out into the world together; empty-handed we would
fare forth together and defy the world. I said that he should be my
knight-errant, my paladin!
</p>

<p>
Otto said he would be it.
</p>

<p>
He has consented. But he says we must not fare forth empty-handed. I do not
know why he thinks this, but he is firm, and I yield to my lord. He is making
all our preparations.
</p>

<p>
Each morning I bring to the meadow a little bundle of my things and give them
to my knight-errant and he takes them to the inn where he is staying.
</p>

<p>
Last week I brought my jewel-case, and yesterday, at his request, I took my
money from the bank and brought it to my paladin. It will be so safe with him.
</p>

<p>
To-day he said that I shall need some little things to remember my father and
mother by when we are gone. So I am to take my father&rsquo;s gold watch while
he is asleep. My hero! How thoughtful he is of my happiness.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Next Day.
</p>

<p>
All is ready. To-morrow I am to meet Otto at the meadow with the watch and the
rest of the things.
</p>

<p>
To-morrow night we are to flee together. I am to go down to the little gate at
the foot of the garden, and Otto will be there.
</p>

<p>
To-day I have wandered about the house and garden and have said good-bye. I
have said good-bye to my Tchupvskja flower, and to the birds and the bees.
</p>

<p>
To-morrow it will be all over.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">
Next Evening.
</p>

<p>
How can I write what has happened! My soul is shattered to its depths.
</p>

<p>
All that I dreaded most has happened. How can I live!
</p>

<p>
Alexis has come back. He and Otto have fought.
</p>

<p>
Ah God! it has been terrible.
</p>

<p>
I stood with Otto in the meadow. I had brought him the watch, and I gave it to
him, and all my love and my life with it.
</p>

<p>
Then, as we stood, I turned and saw Alexis Alexovitch striding towards us
through the grass.
</p>

<p>
How tall and soldierly he looked! And the thought flashed through my mind that
if Otto killed him he would be lying there a dead, inanimate thing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go, Otto,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;go, if you stay you will kill
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Otto looked and saw Alexis coming. He turned one glance at me: his face was
full of infinite meaning.
</p>

<p>
Then, for my sake, he ran. How noble he looked as he ran. Brave heart! he dared
not stay and risk the outburst of his anger.
</p>

<p>
But Alexis overtook him.
</p>

<p>
Then beside the river-bank they fought. Ah! but it was terrible to see them
fight. Is it not awful when men fight together?
</p>

<p>
I could only stand and wring my hands and look on in agony!
</p>

<p>
First, Alexis seized Otto by the waistband of his trousers and swung him round
and round in the air. I could see Otto&rsquo;s face as he went round: the same
mute courage was written on it as when he turned to run. Alexis swung Otto
round and round until his waistband broke, and he was thrown into the grass.
</p>

<p>
That was the first part of the fight.
</p>

<p>
Then Alexis stood beside Otto and kicked him from behind as he lay in the
grass, and they fought like that for some time. That was the second part of the
fight. Then came the third and last part. Alexis picked up the easel and
smashed the picture over Otto&rsquo;s head. It fastened itself like a collar
about his neck. Then Alexis picked Otto up with the picture round his neck and
threw him into the stream.
</p>

<p>
He floated!
</p>

<p>
My paladin!
</p>

<p>
He floated!
</p>

<p>
I could see his upturned face as he floated onwards down the stream, through
the meadow! It was full of deep resignation.
</p>

<p>
Then Alexis Alexovitch came to me and gathered me up in his arms and carried me
thus across the meadow&mdash;he is so tall and strong&mdash; and whispered that
he loved me, and that to-morrow he would shield me from the world. He carried
me thus to the house in his arms among the grass and flowers; and there was my
father, Ivan Ivanovitch, and my mother, Katoosha Katooshavitch. And to-morrow I
am to marry Alexis. He had brought back from the inn my jewels and my money,
and he gave me again the diamond clasp that Otto had taken from my waist.
</p>

<p>
How can I bear it? Alexis is to take me to Petersburg, and he has bought a
beautiful house in the Prospekt, and I am to live in it with him, and we are to
be rich, and I am to be presented at the Court of Nicholas Romanoff and his
wife. Ah! Is it not dreadful?
</p>

<p>
And I can only think of Otto floating down the stream with the easel about his
neck. From the little river he will float into the Dnieper, and from the
Dnieper into the Bug, and from the Bug he will float down the Volga, and from
the Volga into the Caspian Sea. And from the Caspian Sea there is no outlet,
and Otto will float round and round it for ever.
</p>

<p>
Is it not dreadful?

<h2><a name="chap07"></a>VII.<br />
Hannah of the Highlands:<br />
or, The Laird of Loch Aucherlocherty</h2>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Sair maun ye greet, but hoot awa!<br />
There&rsquo;s muckle yet, love isna&rsquo; a&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
Nae more ye&rsquo;ll see, howe&rsquo;er ye whine<br />
The bonnie breeks of Auld Lang Syne!&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>
The simple words rang out fresh and sweet upon the morning air.
</p>

<p>
It was Hannah of the Highlands. She was gathering lobsters in the burn that ran
through the glen.
</p>

<p>
The scene about her was typically Highland. Wild hills rose on both sides of
the burn to a height of seventy-five feet, covered with a dense Highland forest
that stretched a hundred yards in either direction. At the foot of the burn a
beautiful Scotch loch lay in the hollow of the hills. Beyond it again, through
the gap of the hills, was the sea. Through the Glen, and close beside the burn
where Hannah stood, wound the road that rose again to follow the cliffs along
the shore.
</p>

<p>
The tourists in the Highlands will find no more beautiful spot than the Glen of
Aucherlocherty.
</p>

<p>
Nor is there any spot which can more justly claim to be historic ground.
</p>

<p>
It was here in the glen that Bonnie Prince Charlie had lain and hidden after
the defeat of Culloden. Almost in the same spot the great boulder still stands
behind which the Bruce had laid hidden after Bannockburn; while behind a number
of lesser stones the Covenanters had concealed themselves during the height of
the Stuart persecution.
</p>

<p>
Through the Glen Montrose had passed on his fateful ride to Killiecrankie;
while at the lower end of it the rock was still pointed out behind which
William Wallace had paused to change his breeches while flying from the wrath
of Rob Roy.
</p>

<p>
Grim memories such as these gave character to the spot.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, most of the great events of Scotch history had taken place in the Glen,
while the little loch had been the scene of some of the most stirring naval
combats in the history of the Grampian Hills.
</p>

<p>
But there was little in the scene which lay so peaceful on this April morning
to recall the sanguinary history of the Glen. Its sides at present were covered
with a thick growth of gorse, elderberry, egg-plants, and ghillie flower, while
the woods about it were loud with the voice of the throstle, the linnet, the
magpie, the jackdaw, and other song-birds of the Highlands.
</p>

<p>
It was a gloriously beautiful Scotch morning. The rain fell softly and quietly,
bringing dampness and moisture, and almost a sense of wetness to the soft moss
underfoot. Grey mists flew hither and thither, carrying with them an
invigorating rawness that had almost a feeling of dampness.
</p>

<p>
It is the memory of such a morning that draws a tear from the eye of Scotchmen
after years of exile. The Scotch heart, reader, can be moved to its depths by
the sight of a raindrop or the sound of a wet rag.
</p>

<p>
And meantime Hannah, the beautiful Highland girl, was singing. The fresh young
voice rose high above the rain. Even the birds seemed to pause to listen, and
as they listened to the simple words of the Gaelic folk-song, fell off the
bough with a thud on the grass.
</p>

<p>
The Highland girl made a beautiful picture as she stood.
</p>

<p>
Her bare feet were in the burn, the rippling water of which laved her ankles.
The lobsters played about her feet, or clung affectionately to her toes, as if
loath to leave the water and be gathered in the folds of her blue apron.
</p>

<p>
It was a scene to charm the heart of a Burne-Jones, or an Alma Tadema, or of
anybody fond of lobsters.
</p>

<p>
The girl&rsquo;s golden hair flowed widely behind her, gathered in a single
braid with a piece of stovepipe wire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you sell me one of your lobsters?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hannah looked up. There, standing in the burn a few yards above her, was the
vision of a young man.
</p>

<p>
The beautiful Highland girl gazed at him fascinated.
</p>

<p>
He seemed a higher order of being.
</p>

<p>
He carried a fishing-rod and basket in his hand. He was dressed in a
salmon-fishing costume of an English gentleman. Salmon-fishing boots reached to
his thighs, while above them he wore a fishing-jacket fastened loosely with a
fishing-belt about his waist. He wore a small fishing-cap on his head.
</p>

<p>
There were no fish in his basket.
</p>

<p>
He drew near to the Highland girl.
</p>

<p>
Hannah knew as she looked at him that it must be Ian McWhinus, the new laird.
</p>

<p>
At sight she loved him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re sair welcome,&rdquo; she said, as she handed to the young
man the finest of her lobsters.
</p>

<p>
He put it in his basket.
</p>

<p>
Then he felt in the pocket of his jacket and brought out a sixpenny-piece.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must let me pay for it,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Hannah took the sixpence and held it a moment, flushing with true Highland
pride.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll no be selling the fush for money,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Something in the girl&rsquo;s speech went straight to the young man&rsquo;s
heart. He handed her half a crown. Whistling lightly, he strode off up the side
of the burn. Hannah stood gazing after him spell-bound. She was aroused from
her reverie by an angry voice calling her name.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hannah, Hannah,&rdquo; cried the voice, &ldquo;come away ben; are ye
daft, lass, that ye stand there keeking at a McWhinus?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Hannah realised what she had done.
</p>

<p>
She had spoken with a McWhinus, a thing that no McShamus had done for a hundred
and fifty years. For nearly two centuries the McShamuses and the McWhinuses,
albeit both dwellers in the Glen, had been torn asunder by one of those painful
divisions by which the life of the Scotch people is broken into fragments.
</p>

<p>
It had arisen out of a point of spiritual belief.
</p>

<p>
It had been six generations agone at a Highland banquet, in the days when the
unrestrained temper of the time gave way to wild orgies, during which
theological discussions raged with unrestrained fury. Shamus McShamus, an
embittered Calvinist, half crazed perhaps with liquor, had maintained that
damnation could be achieved only by faith. Whimper McWhinus had held that
damnation could be achieved also by good works. Inflamed with drink, McShamus
had struck McWhinus across the temple with an oatcake and killed him. McShamus
had been brought to trial. Although defended by some of the most skilled
lawyers of Aucherlocherty, he had been acquitted. On the very night of his
acquittal, Whangus McWhinus, the son of the murdered man, had lain in wait for
Shamus McShamus, in the hollow of the Glen road where it rises to the cliff,
and had shot him through the bagpipes. Since then the feud had raged with
unquenched bitterness for a century and a half.
</p>

<p>
With each generation the difference between the two families became more acute.
They differed on every possible point. They wore different tartans, sat under
different ministers, drank different brands of whisky, and upheld different
doctrines in regard to eternal punishment.
</p>

<p>
To add to the feud the McWhinuses had grown rich, while the McShamuses had
become poor.
</p>

<p>
At least once in every generation a McWhinus or a McShamus had been shot, and
always at the turn of the Glen road where it rose to the edge of the cliff.
Finally, two generations gone, the McWhinuses had been raised to sudden wealth
by the discovery of a coal mine on their land. To show their contempt for the
McShamuses they had left the Glen to live in America. The McShamuses, to show
their contempt for the McWhinuses, had remained in the Glen. The feud was kept
alive in their memory.
</p>

<p>
And now the descendant of the McWhinuses had come back, and bought out the
property of the Laird of Aucherlocherty beside the Glen. Ian McWhinus knew
nothing of the feud. Reared in another atmosphere, the traditions of Scotland
had no meaning for him. He had entirely degenerated. To him the tartan had
become only a piece of coloured cloth. He wore a kilt as a masquerade costume
for a Hallowe&rsquo;en dance, and when it rained he put on a raincoat. He was
no longer Scotch. More than that, he had married a beautiful American wife, a
talcum-powder blonde with a dough face and the exquisite rotundity of the
packing-house district of the Middle-West. Ian McWhinus was her slave. For her
sake he had bought the lobster from Hannah. For her sake, too, he had
scrutinised closely the beautiful Highland girl, for his wife was anxious to
bring back a Scotch housemaid with her to Chicago.
</p>

<p>
And meantime Hannah, with the rapture of a new love in her heart, followed her
father, Oyster McOyster McShamus, to the cottage. Oyster McOyster, even in
advancing age, was a fine specimen of Scotch manhood. Ninety-seven years of
age, he was approaching the time when many of his countrymen begin to show the
ravages of time. But he bore himself straight as a lath, while his tall stature
and his native Highland costume accentuated the fine outline of his form. This
costume consisted of a black velvet beetle-shell jacket, which extended from
the shoulder half-way down the back, and was continued in a short kilt of the
tartan of the McShamuses, which extended from the waist half-way to the thigh.
The costume reappeared again after an interval in the form of rolled golf
stockings, which extended half-way up to the knee, while on his feet a pair of
half shoes were buckled half-way up with a Highland clasp. On his head half-way
between the ear and the upper superficies of the skull he wore half a Scotch
cap, from which a tall rhinoceros feather extended half-way into the air.
</p>

<p>
A pair of bagpipes were beneath his arm, from which, as he walked, he blew
those deep and plaintive sounds which have done much to imprint upon the
characters of those who hear them a melancholy and resigned despair.
</p>

<p>
At the door of the cottage he turned and faced his daughter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What said Ian McWhinus to you i&rsquo; the burnside?&rdquo; he said
fiercely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas nae muckle,&rdquo; said Hannah, and she added, for the truth
was ever more to her than her father&rsquo;s wrath, &ldquo;he gi&rsquo;ed me
saxpence for a fush.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Siller!&rdquo; shrieked the Highlander. &ldquo;Siller from a
McWhinus!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hannah handed him the sixpence. Oyster McOyster dashed it fiercely on the
ground, then picking it up he dashed it with full force against the wall of the
cottage. Then, seizing it again he dashed it angrily into the pocket of his
kilt.
</p>

<p>
They entered the cottage.
</p>

<p>
Hannah had never seen her father&rsquo;s face so dour as it looked that night.
</p>

<p>
Their home seemed changed.
</p>

<p>
Hannah and her mother and father sat down that night in silence to their simple
meal of oatmeal porridge and Scotch whisky. In the evening the mother sat to
her spinning. Busily she plied her work, for it was a task of love. Her eldest
born, Jamie, was away at college at Edinburgh, preparing for the ministry. His
graduation day was approaching, and Jamie&rsquo;s mother was spinning him a
pair of breeches against the day. The breeches were to be a surprise. Already
they were shaping that way. Oyster McShamus sat reading the Old Testament in
silence, while Hannah looked into the peat fire and thought of the beautiful
young Laird. Only once the Highlander spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The McWhinus is back,&rdquo; he said, and his glance turned towards the
old flint-lock musket on the wall. That night Hannah dreamed of the feud, of
the Glen and the burn, of love, of lobsters, and of the Laird of Loch
Aucherlocherty. And when she rose in the morning there was a wistful look in
her eyes, and there came no song from her throat.
</p>

<p>
The days passed.
</p>

<p>
Each day the beautiful Highland girl saw the young Laird, though her father
knew it not.
</p>

<p>
In the mornings she would see him as he came fishing to the burn. At times he
wore his fishing-suit, at other times he had on a knickerbocker suit of
shepherd&rsquo;s plaid with a domino pattern <i>négligé</i> shirt. For his sake
the beautiful Highland girl made herself more beautiful still. Each morning she
would twine a Scotch thistle in her hair, and pin a spray of burdock at her
heart.
</p>

<p>
And at times he spoke to her. How Hannah treasured his words. Once, catching
sight of her father in the distance, he had asked her who was the old sardine
in the petticoats, and the girl had answered gladly that it was her father,
for, as a fisherman&rsquo;s daughter, she was proud to have her father mistaken
for a sardine.
</p>

<p>
At another time he had asked her if she was handy about the work of the house.
How Hannah&rsquo;s heart had beat at the question. She made up her mind to spin
him a pair of breeches like the ones now finishing for her brother Jamie.
</p>

<p>
And every evening as the sun set Hannah would watch in secret from the window
of the cottage waiting for the young Laird to come past in his motor-car, down
the Glen road to the sea. Always he would slacken the car at the sharp turn at
the top of the cliff. For six generations no McWhinus had passed that spot
after nightfall with his life. But Ian McWhinus knew nothing of the feud.
</p>

<p>
At times Oyster McOyster would see him pass, and standing at the roadside would
call down Gaelic curses on his head.
</p>

<p>
Once, when her father was from home, Hannah had stood on the roadside, and Ian
had stopped the machine and had taken her with him in the car for a ride.
Hannah, her heart beating with delight, had listened to him as he explained how
the car was worked. Had her father know that she had sat thus beside a
McWhinus, he would have slain her where she sat.
</p>

<p>
The tragedy of Hannah&rsquo;s love ran swiftly to its close.
</p>

<p>
Each day she met the young Laird at the burn.
</p>

<p>
Each day she gave him the finest of her lobsters. She wore a new thistle every
day.
</p>

<p>
And every night, in secret as her mother slept, she span a new concentric
section of his breeches.
</p>

<p>
And the young Laird, when he went home, said to the talcum blonde, that the
Highland fisher-girl was not half such a damn fool as she seemed.
</p>

<p>
Then came the fateful afternoon.
</p>

<p>
He stood beside her at the burn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hannah,&rdquo; he said, as he bent towards her, &ldquo;I want to take
you to America.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hannah had fallen fainting in his arms.
</p>

<p>
Ian propped her against a tree, and went home.
</p>

<p>
An hour later, when Hannah entered her home, her father was standing behind the
fireplace. He was staring fixedly into the fire, with the flint-lock musket in
his hands. There was the old dour look of the feud upon his face, and there
were muttered curses on his lips. His wife Ellen clung to his arm and vainly
sought to quiet him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curse him,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll e&rsquo;en kill him the
night as he passes in his deil machine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Hannah knew that Oyster McShamus had seen her with Ian beside the burn.
She turned and fled from the house. Straight up the road she ran across towards
the manor-house of Aucherlocherty to warn Ian. To save him from her
father&rsquo;s wrath, that was her one thought. Night gathered about the
Highland girl as she ran. The rain clouds and the gathering storm hung low with
fitful lightning overhead. She still ran on. About her was the rolling of the
thunder and the angry roaring of the swollen burn. Then the storm broke upon
the darkness with all the fury of the Highland gale. The sky was rent with the
fierce play of the elements. Yet on Hannah ran. Again and again the lightning
hit her, but she ran on still. She fell over the stones, tripped and stumbled
in the ruts, butted into the hedges, cannoned off against the stone walls. But
she never stopped. She went quicker and quicker. The storm was awful.
Lightning, fire, flame, and thunder were all about her. Trees were falling,
hurdles were flying, birds were being struck by lightning. Dogs, sheep and even
cattle were hurled through the air.
</p>

<p>
She reached the manor-house, and stood a moment at the door. The storm had
lulled, the rain ceased, and for a brief moment there was quiet. The light was
streaming from the windows of the house. Hannah paused. Suddenly her heart
misgave her. Her quick ear had caught the sound of a woman&rsquo;s voice
within. She approached the window and looked in. Then, as if rooted to the
spot, the Highland girl gazed and listened at the pane.
</p>

<p>
Ian lay upon a sofa. The <i>négligé</i> dressing-gown that he wore enhanced the
pallid beauty of his face. Beside him sat the talcum-powder blonde. She was
feeding him with chocolates. Hannah understood. Ian had trifled with her love.
He had bought her lobsters to win her heart, only to cast it aside.
</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Hannah Understood&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>
Hannah turned from the window. She plucked the thistle from her throat and
flung it on the ground. Then, as she turned her eye, she caught sight of the
motor standing in the shed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The deil machine!&rdquo; she muttered, while the wild light of Highland
frenzy gathered in her eye; then, as she rushed to it and tore the tarpaulin
from off it, &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no be wanting of a mark the night, Oyster
McShamus,&rdquo; she cried.
</p>

<p>
A moment later, the motor, with Hannah at the wheel, was thundering down the
road to the Glen. The power was on to the full, and the demented girl clung
tight to the steering-gear as the machine rocked and thundered down the
descent. The storm was raging again, and the thunder mingled with the roar of
the machine as it coursed madly towards the sea. The great eye of the motor
blazed in front. The lurid light of it flashed a second on the trees and the
burn as it passed, and flashed blinding on the eyes of Oyster as he stood erect
on the cliff-side below, musket in hand, and faced the blazing apparition that
charged upon him with the old Highland blood surging in his veins.
</p>

<p>
It was all over in a moment&mdash;a blinding flash of lightning, the report of
a musket, a great peal of thunder, and the motor bearing the devoted girl
hurled headlong over the cliff.
</p>

<p>
They found her there in the morning. She lay on her side motionless, half
buried in the sand, upturned towards the blue Highland sky, serene now after
the passing of the storm. Quiet and still she lay. The sea-birds seemed to
pause in their flight to look down on her. The little group of Scotch people
that had gathered stood and gazed at her with reverential awe. They made no
attempt to put her together. It would have been useless. Her gasoline tubes
were twisted and bent, her tank burst, her sprockets broken from their sides,
and her steering-gear an utter wreck. The motor would never run again.
</p>

<p>
After a time they roused themselves from their grief and looked about for
Hannah. They found her. She lay among the sand and seaweed, her fair hair
soaked in gasoline. Then they looked about for Oyster McShamus. Him, too, they
found, lying half buried in the grass and soaked in whisky. Then they looked
about for Ellen. They found her lying across the door of the cottage half
buried in Jamie&rsquo;s breeches.
</p>

<p>
Then they gathered them up. Life was not extinct. They chafed their hands. They
rubbed their feet. They put hot bricks upon their stomachs. They poured hot
whisky down their throats. That brought them to.
</p>

<p>
Of course.
</p>

<p>
It always does.
</p>

<p>
They all lived.
</p>

<p>
But the feud was done for. That was the end of it. Hannah had put it to the
bad.

<h2><a name="chap08"></a>VIII.<br />
Soaked in Seaweed:<br />
or, Upset in the Ocean</h2>

<p class="center">
(<i>An Old-fashioned Sea Story.</i>)
</p>

<p>
It was in August in 1867 that I stepped on board the deck of the <i>Saucy
Sally</i>, lying in dock at Gravesend, to fill the berth of second mate.
</p>

<p>
Let me first say a word about myself.
</p>

<p>
I was a tall, handsome young fellow, squarely and powerfully built, bronzed by
the sun and the moon (and even copper-coloured in spots from the effect of the
stars), and with a face in which honesty, intelligence, and exceptional brain
power were combined with Christianity, simplicity, and modesty.
</p>

<p>
As I stepped on the deck I could not help a slight feeling of triumph, as I
caught sight of my sailor-like features reflected in a tar-barrel that stood
beside the mast, while a little later I could scarcely repress a sense of
gratification as I noticed them reflected again in a bucket of bilge water.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Welcome on board, Mr. Blowhard,&rdquo; called out Captain Bilge,
stepping out of the binnacle and shaking hands across the taffrail.
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus07"></a>
<a href="images/image07.jpg">
<img src="images/image07.jpg" width="353" height="500" alt="Illustration:" /></a>
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Welcome on board, Mr. Blowhard&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>
I saw before me a fine sailor-like man of from thirty to sixty, clean-shaven,
except for an enormous pair of whiskers, a heavy beard, and a thick moustache,
powerful in build, and carrying his beam well aft, in a pair of broad duck
trousers across the back of which there would have been room to write a history
of the British Navy.
</p>

<p>
Beside him were the first and third mates, both of them being quiet men of poor
stature, who looked at Captain Bilge with what seemed to me an apprehensive
expression in their eyes.
</p>

<p>
The vessel was on the eve of departure. Her deck presented that scene of bustle
and alacrity dear to the sailor&rsquo;s heart. Men were busy nailing up the
masts, hanging the bowsprit over the side, varnishing the lee-scuppers and
pouring hot tar down the companion-way.
</p>

<p>
Captain Bilge, with a megaphone to his lips, kept calling out to the men in his
rough sailor fashion:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then, don&rsquo;t over-exert yourselves, gentlemen. Remember,
please, that we have plenty of time. Keep out of the sun as much as you can.
Step carefully in the rigging there, Jones; I fear it&rsquo;s just a little
high for you. Tut, tut, Williams, don&rsquo;t get yourself so dirty with that
tar, you won&rsquo;t look fit to be seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I stood leaning over the gaff of the mainsail and thinking&mdash;yes, thinking,
dear reader, of my mother. I hope that you will think none the less of me for
that. Whenever things look dark, I lean up against something and think of
mother. If they get positively black, I stand on one leg and think of father.
After that I can face anything.
</p>

<p>
Did I think, too, of another, younger than mother and fairer than father? Yes,
I did. &ldquo;Bear up, darling,&rdquo; I had whispered as she nestled her head
beneath my oilskins and kicked out backward with one heel in the agony of her
girlish grief, &ldquo;in five years the voyage will be over, and after three
more like it, I shall come back with money enough to buy a second-hand
fishing-net and settle down on shore.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Meantime the ship&rsquo;s preparations were complete. The masts were all in
position, the sails nailed up, and men with axes were busily chopping away the
gangway.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; called the Captain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then hoist the anchor in board and send a man down with the key to open
the bar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Opening the bar! the last sad rite of departure. How often in my voyages have I
seen it; the little group of men soon to be exiled from their home, standing
about with saddened faces, waiting to see the man with the key open the
bar&mdash;held there by some strange fascination.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Next morning with a fair wind astern we had buzzed around the corner of England
and were running down the Channel.
</p>

<p>
I know no finer sight, for those who have never seen it, than the English
Channel. It is the highway of the world. Ships of all nations are passing up
and down, Dutch, Scotch, Venezuelan, and even American.
</p>

<p>
Chinese junks rush to and fro. Warships, motor yachts, icebergs, and lumber
rafts are everywhere. If I add to this fact that so thick a fog hangs over it
that it is entirely hidden from sight, my readers can form some idea of the
majesty of the scene.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
We had now been three days at sea. My first sea-sickness was wearing off, and I
thought less of father.
</p>

<p>
On the third morning Captain Bilge descended to my cabin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Blowhard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must ask you to stand double
watches.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; I inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The two other mates have fallen overboard,&rdquo; he said uneasily, and
avoiding my eye.
</p>

<p>
I contented myself with saying &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; but I could not
help thinking it a trifle odd that both the mates should have fallen overboard
in the same night.
</p>

<p>
Surely there was some mystery in this.
</p>

<p>
Two mornings later the Captain appeared at the breakfast-table with the same
shifting and uneasy look in his eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anything wrong, sir?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, trying to appear at ease and twisting a fried
egg to and fro between his fingers with such nervous force as almost to break
it in two&mdash;&ldquo;I regret to say that we have lost the bosun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The bosun!&rdquo; I cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Captain Bilge more quietly, &ldquo;he is overboard. I
blame myself for it, partly. It was early this morning. I was holding him up in
my arms to look at an iceberg and, quite accidentally I assure you&mdash;I
dropped him overboard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Captain Bilge,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;have you taken any steps to
recover him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not as yet,&rdquo; he replied uneasily.
</p>

<p>
I looked at him fixedly, but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
Ten days passed.
</p>

<p>
The mystery thickened. On Thursday two men of the starboard watch were reported
missing. On Friday the carpenter&rsquo;s assistant disappeared. On the night of
Saturday a circumstance occurred which, slight as it was, gave me some clue as
to what was happening.
</p>

<p>
As I stood at the wheel about midnight, I saw the Captain approach in the
darkness carrying the cabin-boy by the hind leg. The lad was a bright little
fellow, whose merry disposition had already endeared him to me, and I watched
with some interest to see what the Captain would do to him. Arrived at the
stern of the vessel, Captain Bilge looked cautiously around a moment and then
dropped the boy into the sea. For a brief instant the lad&rsquo;s head appeared
in the phosphorus of the waves. The Captain threw a boot at him, sighed deeply,
and went below.
</p>

<p>
Here then was the key to the mystery! The Captain was throwing the crew
overboard. Next morning we met at breakfast as usual.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor little Williams has fallen overboard,&rdquo; said the Captain,
seizing a strip of ship&rsquo;s bacon and tearing at it with his teeth as if he
almost meant to eat it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; I said, greatly excited, stabbing at a ship&rsquo;s loaf
in my agitation with such ferocity as almost to drive my knife into it&mdash;
&ldquo;You threw that boy overboard!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Captain Bilge, grown suddenly quiet, &ldquo;I threw
them all over and intend to throw the rest. Listen, Blowhard, you are young,
ambitious, and trustworthy. I will confide in you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Perfectly calm now, he stepped to a locker, rummaged in it a moment, and drew
out a faded piece of yellow parchment, which he spread on the table. It was a
map or chart. In the centre of it was a circle. In the middle of the circle was
a small dot and a letter T, while at one side of the map was a letter N, and
against it on the other side a letter S.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you not guess?&rdquo; queried Captain Bilge. &ldquo;It is a desert
island.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I rejoined with a sudden flash of intuition, &ldquo;and N is
for North and S is for South.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Blowhard,&rdquo; said the Captain, striking the table with such force as
to cause a loaf of ship&rsquo;s bread to bounce up and down three or four
times, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve struck it. That part of it had not yet occurred to
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the letter T?&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The treasure, the buried treasure,&rdquo; said the Captain, and turning
the map over he read from the back of it&mdash;&ldquo;The point T indicates the
spot where the treasure is buried under the sand; it consists of half a million
Spanish dollars, and is buried in a brown leather dress-suit case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And where is the island?&rdquo; I inquired, mad with excitement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I do not know,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;I intend to sail up
and down the parallels of latitude until I find it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And meantime?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Meantime, the first thing to do is to reduce the number of the crew so
as to have fewer hands to divide among. Come, come,&rdquo; he added in a burst
of frankness which made me love the man in spite of his shortcomings,
&ldquo;will you join me in this? We&rsquo;ll throw them all over, keeping the
cook to the last, dig up the treasure, and be rich for the rest of our
lives.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Reader, do you blame me if I said yes? I was young, ardent, ambitious, full of
bright hopes and boyish enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Captain Bilge,&rdquo; I said, putting my hand in his, &ldquo;I am
yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now go forward to the forecastle and get an
idea what the men are thinking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I went forward to the men&rsquo;s quarters&mdash;a plain room in the front of
the ship, with only a rough carpet on the floor, a few simple arm-chairs,
writing-desks, spittoons of a plain pattern, and small brass beds with
blue-and-green screens. It was Sunday morning, and the men were mostly sitting
about in their dressing-gowns.
</p>

<p>
They rose as I entered and curtseyed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Tompkins, the bosun&rsquo;s mate, &ldquo;I think it my
duty to tell you that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction among the
men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Several of the men nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like the way the men keep going overboard,&rdquo; he
continued, his voice rising to a tone of uncontrolled passion. &ldquo;It is
positively absurd, sir, and if you will allow me to say so, the men are far
from pleased.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tompkins,&rdquo; I said sternly, &ldquo;you must understand that my
position will not allow me to listen to mutinous language of this sort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I returned to the Captain. &ldquo;I think the men mean mutiny,&rdquo; I said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Captain Bilge, rubbing his hands, &ldquo;that will get
rid of a lot of them, and of course,&rdquo; he added musingly, looking out of
the broad old-fashioned port-hole at the stern of the cabin, at the heaving
waves of the South Atlantic, &ldquo;I am expecting pirates at any time, and
that will take out quite a few of them. However&rdquo;&mdash;and here he
pressed the bell for a cabin-boy&mdash;&ldquo;kindly ask Mr. Tompkins to step
this way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tompkins,&rdquo; said the Captain as the bosun&rsquo;s mate entered,
&ldquo;be good enough to stand on the locker and stick your head through the
stern port-hole, and tell me what you think of the weather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; replied the tar with a simplicity which caused us
to exchange a quiet smile.
</p>

<p>
Tompkins stood on the locker and put his head and shoulders out of the port.
</p>

<p>
Taking a leg each we pushed him through. We heard him plump into the sea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tompkins was easy,&rdquo; said Captain Bilge. &ldquo;Excuse me as I
enter his death in the log.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued presently, &ldquo;it will be a great help if
they mutiny. I suppose they will, sooner or later. It&rsquo;s customary to do
so. But I shall take no step to precipitate it until we have first fallen in
with pirates. I am expecting them in these latitudes at any time. Meantime, Mr.
Blowhard,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;if you can continue to drop overboard
one or two more each week, I shall feel extremely grateful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Three days later we rounded the Cape of Good Hope and entered upon the inky
waters of the Indian Ocean. Our course lay now in zigzags and, the weather
being favourable, we sailed up and down at a furious rate over a sea as calm as
glass.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day a pirate ship appeared. Reader, I do not know if you have
ever seen a pirate ship. The sight was one to appal the stoutest heart. The
entire ship was painted black, a black flag hung at the masthead, the sails
were black, and on the deck people dressed all in black walked up and down
arm-in-arm. The words &ldquo;Pirate Ship&rdquo; were painted in white letters
on the bow. At the sight of it our crew were visibly cowed. It was a spectacle
that would have cowed a dog.
</p>

<p>
The two ships were brought side by side. They were then lashed tightly together
with bag string and binder twine, and a gang plank laid between them. In a
moment the pirates swarmed upon our deck, rolling their eyes, gnashing their
teeth and filing their nails.
</p>

<p>
Then the fight began. It lasted two hours&mdash;with fifteen minutes off for
lunch. It was awful. The men grappled with one another, kicked one another from
behind, slapped one another across the face, and in many cases completely lost
their temper and tried to bite one another. I noticed one gigantic fellow
brandishing a knotted towel, and striking right and left among our men, until
Captain Bilge rushed at him and struck him flat across the mouth with a banana
skin.
</p>

<p>
At the end of two hours, by mutual consent, the fight was declared a draw. The
points standing at sixty-one and a half against sixty-two.
</p>

<p>
The ships were unlashed, and with three cheers from each crew, were headed on
their way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said the Captain to me aside, &ldquo;let us see how
many of the crew are sufficiently exhausted to be thrown overboard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went below. In a few minutes he re-appeared, his face deadly pale.
&ldquo;Blowhard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the ship is sinking. One of the pirates
(sheer accident, of course, I blame no one) has kicked a hole in the side. Let
us sound the well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We put our ear to the ship&rsquo;s well. It sounded like water.
</p>

<p>
The men were put to the pumps and worked with the frenzied effort which only
those who have been drowned in a sinking ship can understand.
</p>

<p>
At six p.m. the well marked one half an inch of water, at nightfall
three-quarters of an inch, and at daybreak, after a night of unremitting toil,
seven-eighths of an inch.
</p>

<p>
By noon of the next day the water had risen to fifteen-sixteenths of an inch,
and on the next night the sounding showed thirty-one thirty-seconds of an inch
of water in the hold. The situation was desperate. At this rate of increase
few, if any, could tell where it would rise to in a few days.
</p>

<p>
That night the Captain called me to his cabin. He had a book of mathematical
tables in front of him, and great sheets of vulgar fractions littered the floor
on all sides.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The ship is bound to sink,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in fact, Blowhard, she
is sinking. I can prove it. It may be six months or it may take years, but if
she goes on like this, sink she must. There is nothing for it but to abandon
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That night, in the dead of darkness, while the crew were busy at the pumps, the
Captain and I built a raft.
</p>

<p>
Unobserved we cut down the masts, chopped them into suitable lengths, laid them
crosswise in a pile and lashed them tightly together with bootlaces.
</p>

<p>
Hastily we threw on board a couple of boxes of food and bottles of drinking
fluid, a sextant, a cronometer, a gas-meter, a bicycle pump and a few other
scientific instruments. Then taking advantage of a roll in the motion of the
ship, we launched the raft, lowered ourselves upon a line, and under cover of
the heavy dark of a tropical night, we paddled away from the doomed vessel.
</p>

<p>
The break of day found us a tiny speck on the Indian Ocean. We looked about as
big as this (.).
</p>

<p>
In the morning, after dressing, and shaving as best we could, we opened our box
of food and drink.
</p>

<p>
Then came the awful horror of our situation.
</p>

<p>
One by one the Captain took from the box the square blue tins of canned beef
which it contained. We counted fifty-two in all. Anxiously and with drawn faces
we watched until the last can was lifted from the box. A single thought was in
our minds. When the end came the Captain stood up on the raft with wild eyes
staring at the sky.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The can-opener!&rdquo; he shrieked, &ldquo;just Heaven, the
can-opener.&rdquo; He fell prostrate.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, with trembling hands, I opened the box of bottles. It contained lager
beer bottles, each with a patent tin top. One by one I took them out. There
were fifty-two in all. As I withdrew the last one and saw the empty box before
me, I shroke out&mdash;&ldquo;The thing! the thing! oh, merciful Heaven! The
thing you open them with!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I fell prostrate upon the Captain.
</p>

<p>
We awoke to find ourselves still a mere speck upon the ocean. We felt even
smaller than before.
</p>

<p>
Over us was the burnished copper sky of the tropics. The heavy, leaden sea
lapped the sides of the raft. All about us was a litter of corn beef cans and
lager beer bottles. Our sufferings in the ensuing days were indescribable. We
beat and thumped at the cans with our fists. Even at the risk of spoiling the
tins for ever we hammered them fiercely against the raft. We stamped on them,
bit at them and swore at them. We pulled and clawed at the bottles with our
hands, and chipped and knocked them against the cans, regardless even of
breaking the glass and ruining the bottles.
</p>

<p>
It was futile.
</p>

<p>
Then day after day we sat in moody silence, gnawed with hunger, with nothing to
read, nothing to smoke, and practically nothing to talk about.
</p>

<p>
On the tenth day the Captain broke silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get ready the lots, Blowhard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to
come to that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered drearily, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re getting thinner
every day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then, with the awful prospect of cannibalism before us, we drew lots.
</p>

<p>
I prepared the lots and held them to the Captain. He drew the longer one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Which does that mean,&rdquo; he asked, trembling between hope and
despair. &ldquo;Do I win?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Bilge,&rdquo; I said sadly, &ldquo;you lose.&rdquo;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
But I mustn&rsquo;t dwell on the days that followed&mdash;the long quiet days
of lazy dreaming on the raft, during which I slowly built up my strength, which
had been shattered by privation. They were days, dear reader, of deep and quiet
peace, and yet I cannot recall them without shedding a tear for the brave man
who made them what they were.
</p>

<p>
It was on the fifth day after that I was awakened from a sound sleep by the
bumping of the raft against the shore. I had eaten perhaps overheartily, and
had not observed the vicinity of land.
</p>

<p>
Before me was an island, the circular shape of which, with its low, sandy
shore, recalled at once its identity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The treasure island,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;at last I am rewarded for
all my heroism.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In a fever of haste I rushed to the centre of the island. What was the sight
that confronted me? A great hollow scooped in the sand, an empty dress-suit
case lying beside it, and on a ship&rsquo;s plank driven deep into the sand,
the legend, &ldquo;<i>Saucy Sally</i>, October, 1867.&rdquo; So! the miscreants
had made good the vessel, headed it for the island of whose existence they must
have learned from the chart we so carelessly left upon the cabin table, and had
plundered poor Bilge and me of our well-earned treasure!
</p>

<p>
Sick with the sense of human ingratitude I sank upon the sand.
</p>

<p>
The island became my home.
</p>

<p>
There I eked out a miserable existence, feeding on sand and gravel and dressing
myself in cactus plants. Years passed. Eating sand and mud slowly undermined my
robust constitution. I fell ill. I died. I buried myself.
</p>

<p>
Would that others who write sea stories would do as much.

Caroline&rsquo;s Christmas:<br />
or, The Inexplicable Infant</h2>

<p>
It was Xmas&mdash;Xmas with its mantle of white snow, scintillating from a
thousand diamond points, Xmas with its good cheer, its peace on
earth&mdash;Xmas with its feasting and merriment, Xmas with its&mdash;well,
anyway, it was Xmas.
</p>

<p>
Or no, that&rsquo;s a slight slip; it wasn&rsquo;t exactly Xmas, it was Xmas
Eve, Xmas Eve with its mantle of white snow lying beneath the calm
moonlight&mdash;and, in fact, with practically the above list of accompanying
circumstances with a few obvious emendations.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it was Xmas Eve.
</p>

<p>
And more than that!
</p>

<p>
Listen to <i>where</i> it was Xmas.
</p>

<p>
It was Xmas Eve on the Old Homestead. Reader, do you know, by sight, the Old
Homestead? In the pauses of your work at your city desk, where you have grown
rich and avaricious, does it never rise before your mind&rsquo;s eye, the quiet
old homestead that knew you as a boy before your greed of gold tore you away
from it? The Old Homestead that stands beside the road just on the rise of the
hill, with its dark spruce trees wrapped in snow, the snug barns and the straw
stacks behind it; while from its windows there streams a shaft of light from a
coal-oil lamp, about as thick as a slate pencil that you can see four miles
away, from the other side of the cedar swamp in the hollow. Don&rsquo;t talk to
me of your modern searchlights and your incandescent arcs, beside that gleam of
light from the coal-oil lamp in the farmhouse window. It will shine clear to
the heart across thirty years of distance. Do you not turn, I say, sometimes,
reader, from the roar and hustle of the city with its ill-gotten wealth and its
godless creed of mammon, to think of the quiet homestead under the brow of the
hill? You don&rsquo;t! Well, you skunk!
</p>

<p>
It was Xmas Eve.
</p>

<p>
The light shone from the windows of the homestead farm. The light of the log
fire rose and flickered and mingled its red glare on the windows with the calm
yellow of the lamplight.
</p>

<p>
John Enderby and his wife sat in the kitchen room of the farmstead. Do you know
it, reader, the room called the kitchen?&mdash;with the open fire on its old
brick hearth, and the cook stove in the corner. It is the room of the farm
where people cook and eat and live. It is the living-room. The only other room
beside the bedroom is the small room in front, chill-cold in winter, with an
organ in it for playing &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; on, when company came. But
this room is only used for music and funerals. The real room of the old farm is
the kitchen. Does it not rise up before you, reader? It doesn&rsquo;t? Well,
you darn fool!
</p>

<p>
At any rate there sat old John Enderby beside the plain deal table, his head
bowed upon his hands, his grizzled face with its unshorn stubble stricken down
with the lines of devastating trouble. From time to time he rose and cast a
fresh stick of tamarack into the fire with a savage thud that sent a shower of
sparks up the chimney. Across the fireplace sat his wife Anna on a
straight-backed chair, looking into the fire with the mute resignation of her
sex.
</p>

<p>
What was wrong with them anyway? Ah, reader, can you ask? Do you know or
remember so little of the life of the old homestead? When I have said that it
is the Old Homestead and Xmas Eve, and that the farmer is in great trouble and
throwing tamarack at the fire, surely you ought to guess!
</p>

<p>
The Old Homestead was mortgaged! Ten years ago, reckless with debt, crazed with
remorse, mad with despair and persecuted with rheumatism, John Enderby had
mortgaged his farmstead for twenty-four dollars and thirty cents.
</p>

<p>
To-night the mortgage fell due, to-night at midnight, Xmas night. Such is the
way in which mortgages of this kind are always drawn. Yes, sir, it was drawn
with such diabolical skill that on this night of all nights the mortgage would
be foreclosed. At midnight the men would come with hammer and nails and
foreclose it, nail it up tight.
</p>

<p>
So the afflicted couple sat.
</p>

<p>
Anna, with the patient resignation of her sex, sat silent or at times
endeavoured to read. She had taken down from the little wall-shelf
Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Holy Living and Holy Dying</i>. She tried to read it. She
could not. Then she had taken Dante&rsquo;s <i>Inferno</i>. She could not read
it. Then she had selected Kant&rsquo;s <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. But she
could not read it either. Lastly, she had taken the Farmer&rsquo;s Almanac for
1911. The books lay littered about her as she sat in patient despair.
</p>

<p>
John Enderby showed all the passion of an uncontrolled nature. At times he
would reach out for the crock of buttermilk that stood beside him and drained a
draught of the maddening liquid, till his brain glowed like the coals of the
tamarack fire before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; pleaded Anna, &ldquo;leave alone the buttermilk. It only
maddens you. No good ever came of that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aye, lass,&rdquo; said the farmer, with a bitter laugh, as he buried his
head again in the crock, &ldquo;what care I if it maddens me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, John, you&rsquo;d better be employed in reading the Good Book than
in your wild courses. Here take it, father, and read it&rdquo;&mdash;and she
handed to him the well-worn black volume from the shelf. Enderby paused a
moment and held the volume in his hand. He and his wife had known nothing of
religious teaching in the public schools of their day, but the first-class
non-sectarian education that the farmer had received had stood him in good
stead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take the book,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Read, John, in this hour of
affliction; it brings comfort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The farmer took from her hand the well-worn copy of Euclid&rsquo;s
<i>Elements</i>, and laying aside his hat with reverence, he read aloud:
&ldquo;The angles at the base of an isoceles triangle are equal, and whosoever
shall produce the sides, lo, the same also shall be equal each unto
each.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The farmer put the book aside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Anna. I can&rsquo;t read the good words
to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He rose, staggered to the crock of buttermilk, and before his wife could stay
his hand, drained it to the last drop.
</p>

<p>
Then he sank heavily to his chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let them foreclose it, if they will,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am past
caring.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The woman looked sadly into the fire.
</p>

<p>
Ah, if only her son Henry had been here. Henry, who had left them three years
agone, and whose bright letters still brought from time to time the gleam of
hope to the stricken farmhouse.
</p>

<p>
Henry was in Sing Sing. His letters brought news to his mother of his steady
success; first in the baseball nine of the prison, a favourite with his wardens
and the chaplain, the best bridge player of the corridor. Henry was pushing his
way to the front with the old-time spirit of the Enderbys.
</p>

<p>
His mother had hoped that he might have been with her at Xmas, but Henry had
written that it was practically impossible for him to leave Sing Sing. He could
not see his way out. The authorities were arranging a dance and sleighing party
for the Xmas celebration. He had some hope, he said, of slipping away
unnoticed, but his doing so might excite attention.
</p>

<p>
Of the trouble at home Anna had told her son nothing.
</p>

<p>
No, Henry could not come. There was no help there. And William, the other son,
ten years older than Henry. Alas, William had gone forth from the homestead to
fight his way in the great city! &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;when
I make a million dollars I&rsquo;ll come home. Till then good-bye,&rdquo; and
he had gone.
</p>

<p>
How Anna&rsquo;s heart had beat for him. Would he make that million dollars?
Would she ever live to see it? And as the years passed she and John had often
sat in the evenings picturing William at home again, bringing with him a
million dollars, or picturing the million dollars sent by express with love.
But the years had passed. William came not. He did not come. The great city had
swallowed him up as it has many another lad from the old homestead.
</p>

<p>
Anna started from her musing&mdash;
</p>

<p>
What was that at the door? The sound of a soft and timid rapping, and through
the glass of the door-pane, a face, a woman&rsquo;s face looking into the
fire-lit room with pleading eyes. What was it she bore in her arms, the little
bundle that she held tight to her breast to shield it from the falling snow?
Can you guess, reader? Try three guesses and see. Right you are. That&rsquo;s
what it was.
</p>

<p>
The farmer&rsquo;s wife went hastily to the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s mercy!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what are you doing out on
such a night? Come in, child, to the fire!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The woman entered, carrying the little bundle with her, and looking with wide
eyes (they were at least an inch and a half across) at Enderby and his wife.
Anna could see that there was no wedding-ring on her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo; said the farmer&rsquo;s wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My name is Caroline,&rdquo; the girl whispered. The rest was lost in the
low tones of her voice. &ldquo;I want shelter,&rdquo; she paused, &ldquo;I want
you to take the child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Anna took the baby and laid it carefully on the top shelf of the cupboard, then
she hastened to bring a glass of water and a dough-nut, and set it before the
half-frozen girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and warm yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John rose from his seat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no child of that sort here,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;John, John,&rdquo; pleaded Anna, &ldquo;remember what the Good Book
says: &lsquo;Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one
another!&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John sank back in his chair.
</p>

<p>
And why had Caroline no wedding-ring? Ah, reader, can you not guess. Well, you
can&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t what you think at all; so there. Caroline had no
wedding-ring because she had thrown it away in bitterness, as she tramped the
streets of the great city. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;should the wife
of a man in the penitentiary wear a ring.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then she had gone forth with the child from what had been her home.
</p>

<p>
It was the old sad story.
</p>

<p>
She had taken the baby and laid it tenderly, gently on a seat in the park. Then
she walked rapidly away. A few minutes after a man had chased after Caroline
with the little bundle in his arms. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said,
panting, &ldquo;I think you left your baby in the park.&rdquo; Caroline thanked
him.
</p>

<p>
Next she took the baby to the Grand Central Waiting-room, kissed it tenderly,
and laid it on a shelf behind the lunch-counter.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes an official, beaming with satisfaction, had brought it back to
her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yours, I think, madame,&rdquo; he said, as he handed it to her. Caroline
thanked him.
</p>

<p>
Then she had left it at the desk of the Waldorf Astoria, and at the
ticket-office of the subway.
</p>

<p>
It always came back.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice she took it to the Brooklyn Bridge and threw it into the river,
but perhaps something in the way it fell through the air touched the
mother&rsquo;s heart and smote her, and she had descended to the river and
fished it out.
</p>

<p>
Then Caroline had taken the child to the country. At first she thought to leave
it on the wayside and she had put it down in the snow, and standing a little
distance off had thrown mullein stalks at it, but something in the way the
little bundle lay covered in the snow appealed to the mother&rsquo;s heart.
</p>

<p>
She picked it up and went on. &ldquo;Somewhere,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I
shall find a door of kindness open to it.&rdquo; Soon after she had staggered
into the homestead.
</p>

<p>
Anna, with true woman&rsquo;s kindness, asked no questions. She put the baby
carefully away in a trunk, saw Caroline safely to bed in the best room, and
returned to her seat by the fire.
</p>

<p>
The old clock struck twenty minutes past eight.
</p>

<p>
Again a knock sounded at the door.
</p>

<p>
There entered the familiar figure of the village lawyer. His astrachan coat of
yellow dogskin, his celluloid collar, and boots which reached no higher than
the ankle, contrasted with the rude surroundings of the little room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enderby,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can you pay?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lawyer Perkins,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;give me time and I will;
so help me, give me five years more and I&rsquo;ll clear this debt to the last
cent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said the lawyer, touched in spite of his rough (dogskin)
exterior, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, if I would. These things are not what they
were. It&rsquo;s a big New York corporation, Pinchem &amp; Company, that makes
these loans now, and they take their money on the day, or they sell you up. I
can&rsquo;t help it. So there&rsquo;s your notice, John, and I am sorry! No,
I&rsquo;ll take no buttermilk, I must keep a clear head to work,&rdquo; and
with that he hurried out into the snow again.
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus08"></a>
<a href="images/image08.jpg">
<img src="images/image08.jpg" width="355" height="500" alt="Illustration:" /></a>
<p class="caption">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll take no buttermilk, I must keep a

</div>

<p>
John sat brooding in his chair.
</p>

<p>
The fire flickered down.
</p>

<p>
The old clock struck half-past eight, then it half struck a quarter to nine,
then slowly it struck striking.
</p>

<p>
Presently Enderby rose, picked a lantern from its hook, &ldquo;Mortgage or no
mortgage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must see to the stock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He passed out of the house, and standing in the yard, looked over the snow to
the cedar swamp beyond with the snow winding through it, far in the distance
the lights of the village far away.
</p>

<p>
He thought of the forty years he had spent here on the homestead&mdash;the
rude, pioneer days&mdash;the house he had built for himself, with its plain
furniture, the old-fashioned spinning-wheel on which Anna had spun his
trousers, the wooden telephone and the rude skidway on which he ate his meals.
</p>

<p>
He looked out over the swamp and sighed.
</p>

<p>
Down in the swamp, two miles away, could he have but seen it, there moved a
sleigh, and in it a man dressed in a sealskin coat and silk hat, whose face
beamed in the moonlight as he turned to and fro and stared at each object by
the roadside as at an old familiar scene. Round his waist was a belt containing
a million dollars in gold coin, and as he halted his horse in an opening of the
road he unstrapped the belt and counted the coins.
</p>

<p>
Beside him there crouched in the bushes at the dark edge of the swamp road,
with eyes that watched every glitter of the coins, and a hand that grasped a
heavy cudgel of blackthorn, a man whose close-cropped hair and hard lined face
belonged nowhere but within the walls of Sing Sing.
</p>

<p>
When the sleigh started again the man in the bushes followed doggedly in its
track.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile John Enderby had made the rounds of his outbuildings. He bedded the
fat cattle that blinked in the flashing light of the lantern. He stood a moment
among his hogs, and, farmer as he was, forgot his troubles a moment to speak to
each, calling them by name. It smote him to think how at times he had been
tempted to sell one of the hogs, or even to sell the cattle to clear the
mortgage off the place. Thank God, however, he had put that temptation behind
him.
</p>

<p>
As he reached the house a sleigh was standing on the roadway. Anna met him at
the door. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there was a stranger came while
you were in the barn, and wanted a lodging for the night; a city man, I reckon,
by his clothes. I hated to refuse him, and I put him in Willie&rsquo;s room.
We&rsquo;ll never want it again, and he&rsquo;s gone to sleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, we can&rsquo;t refuse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
John Enderby took out the horse to the barn, and then returned to his vigil
with Anna beside the fire.
</p>

<p>
The fumes of the buttermilk had died out of his brain. He was thinking, as he
sat there, of midnight and what it would bring.
</p>

<p>
In the room above, the man in the sealskin coat had thrown himself down,
clothes and all, upon the bed, tired with his drive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How it all comes back to me,&rdquo; he muttered as he fell asleep,
&ldquo;the same old room, nothing changed&mdash;except them&mdash;how worn they
look,&rdquo; and a tear started to his eyes. He thought of his leaving his home
fifteen years ago, of his struggle in the great city, of the great idea he had
conceived of making money, and of the Farm Investment Company he had
instituted&mdash;the simple system of applying the crushing power of capital to
exact the uttermost penny from the farm loans. And now here he was back again,
true to his word, with a million dollars in his belt. &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo;
he had murmured, &ldquo;I will tell them. It will be Xmas.&rdquo; Then
William&mdash;yes, reader, it was William (see line 503 above) had fallen
asleep.
</p>

<p>
The hours passed, and kept passing.
</p>

<p>
It was 11.30.
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly Anna started from her place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Henry!&rdquo; she cried as the door opened and a man entered. He
advanced gladly to meet her, and in a moment mother and son were folded in a
close embrace. It was Henry, the man from Sing Sing. True to his word, he had
slipped away unostentatiously at the height of the festivities.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas, Henry,&rdquo; said the mother after the warmth of the first
greetings had passed, &ldquo;you come at an unlucky hour.&rdquo; They told him
of the mortgage on the farm and the ruin of his home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anna, &ldquo;not even a bed to offer you,&rdquo; and
she spoke of the strangers who had arrived; of the stricken woman and the
child, and the rich man in the sealskin coat who had asked for a night&rsquo;s
shelter.
</p>

<p>
Henry listened intently while they told him of the man, and a sudden light of
intelligence flashed into his eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Heaven, father, I have it!&rdquo; he cried. Then, dropping his voice,
he said, &ldquo;Speak low, father. This man upstairs, he had a sealskin coat
and silk hat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the father.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;I saw a man sitting in a sleigh in the
cedar swamp. He had money in his hand, and he counted it, and
chuckled,&mdash;five dollar gold pieces&mdash;in all, 1,125,465 dollars and a
quarter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The father and son looked at one another.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see your idea,&rdquo; said Enderby sternly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll choke him,&rdquo; said Henry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or club him,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;and pay the mortgage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Anna looked from one to the other, joy and hope struggling with the sorrow in
her face. &ldquo;Henry, my Henry,&rdquo; she said proudly, &ldquo;I knew he
would find a way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Henry; &ldquo;bring the lamp, mother, take the
club, father,&rdquo; and gaily, but with hushed voices, the three stole up the
stairs.
</p>

<p>
The stranger lay sunk in sleep. The back of his head was turned to them as they
came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, mother,&rdquo; said the farmer firmly, &ldquo;hold the lamp a
little nearer; just behind the ear, I think, Henry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Henry, rolling back his sleeve and speaking with the
quick authority that sat well upon him, &ldquo;across the jaw, father,
it&rsquo;s quicker and neater.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the farmer, smiling proudly, &ldquo;have your
own way, lad, you know best.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Henry raised the club.
</p>

<p>
But as he did so&mdash;stay, what was that? Far away behind the cedar swamp the
deep booming of the bell of the village church began to strike out midnight.
One, two, three, its tones came clear across the crisp air. Almost at the same
moment the clock below began with deep strokes to mark the midnight hour; from
the farmyard chicken coop a rooster began to crow twelve times, while the loud
lowing of the cattle and the soft cooing of the hogs seemed to usher in the
morning of Christmas with its message of peace and goodwill.
</p>

<p>
The club fell from Henry&rsquo;s hand and rattled on the floor.
</p>

<p>
The sleeper woke, and sat up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father! Mother!&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My son, my son,&rdquo; sobbed the father, &ldquo;we had guessed it was
you. We had come to wake you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it is I,&rdquo; said William, smiling to his parents, &ldquo;and I
have brought the million dollars. Here it is,&rdquo; and with that he
unstrapped the belt from his waist and laid a million dollars on the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; cried Anna, &ldquo;our troubles are at an end. This
money will help clear the mortgage&mdash;and the greed of Pinchem &amp; Co.
cannot harm us now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The farm was mortgaged!&rdquo; said William, aghast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;mortgaged to men who have no
conscience, whose greedy hand has nearly brought us to the grave. See how she
has aged, my boy,&rdquo; and he pointed to Anna.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said William, in deep tones of contrition, &ldquo;I am
Pinchem &amp; Co. Heaven help me! I see it now. I see at what expense of
suffering my fortune was made. I will restore it all, these million dollars, to
those I have wronged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his mother softly. &ldquo;You repent, dear son, with
true Christian repentance. That is enough. You may keep the money. We will look
upon it as a trust, a sacred trust, and every time we spend a dollar of it on
ourselves we will think of it as a trust.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the farmer softly, &ldquo;your mother is right, the
money is a trust, and we will restock the farm with it, buy out the
Jones&rsquo;s property, and regard the whole thing as a trust.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this moment the door of the room opened. A woman&rsquo;s form appeared. It
was Caroline, robed in one of Anna&rsquo;s directoire nightgowns.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I heard your voices,&rdquo; she said, and then, as she caught sight of
Henry, she gave a great cry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My husband!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; said Henry, and folded her to his heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have left Sing Sing?&rdquo; cried Caroline with joy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Caroline,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;I shall never go back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Gaily the reunited family descended. Anna carried the lamp, Henry carried the
club. William carried the million dollars.
</p>

<p>
The tamarack fire roared again upon the hearth. The buttermilk circulated from
hand to hand. William and Henry told and retold the story of their adventures.
The first streak of the Christmas morn fell through the door-pane.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my sons,&rdquo; said John Enderby, &ldquo;henceforth let us stick to
the narrow path. What is it that the Good Book says: &lsquo;A straight line is
that which lies evenly between its extreme points.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap10"></a>X.<br />
The Man in Asbestos:<br />
An Allegory of the Future</h2>

<p>
To begin with let me admit that I did it on purpose. Perhaps it was partly from
jealousy.
</p>

<p>
It seemed unfair that other writers should be able at will to drop into a sleep
of four or five hundred years, and to plunge head-first into a distant future
and be a witness of its marvels.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to do that too.
</p>

<p>
I always had been, I still am, a passionate student of social problems. The
world of to-day with its roaring machinery, the unceasing toil of its working
classes, its strife, its poverty, its war, its cruelty, appals me as I look at
it. I love to think of the time that must come some day when man will have
conquered nature, and the toil-worn human race enter upon an era of peace.
</p>

<p>
I loved to think of it, and I longed to see it.
</p>

<p>
So I set about the thing deliberately.
</p>

<p>
What I wanted to do was to fall asleep after the customary fashion, for two or
three hundred years at least, and wake and find myself in the marvel world of
the future.
</p>

<p>
I made my preparations for the sleep.
</p>

<p>
I bought all the comic papers that I could find, even the illustrated ones. I
carried them up to my room in my hotel: with them I brought up a pork pie and
dozens and dozens of doughnuts. I ate the pie and the doughnuts, then sat back
in the bed and read the comic papers one after the other. Finally, as I felt
the awful lethargy stealing upon me, I reached out my hand for the <i>London
Weekly Times</i>, and held up the editorial page before my eye.
</p>

<p>
It was, in a way, clear, straight suicide, but I did it.
</p>

<p>
I could feel my senses leaving me. In the room across the hall there was a man
singing. His voice, that had been loud, came fainter and fainter through the
transom. I fell into a sleep, the deep immeasurable sleep in which the very
existence of the outer world was hushed. Dimly I could feel the days go past,
then the years, and then the long passage of the centuries.
</p>

<p>
Then, not as it were gradually, but quite suddenly, I woke up, sat up, and
looked about me.
</p>

<p>
Where was I?
</p>

<p>
Well might I ask myself.
</p>

<p>
I found myself lying, or rather sitting up, on a broad couch. I was in a great
room, dim, gloomy, and dilapidated in its general appearance, and apparently,
from its glass cases and the stuffed figures that they contained, some kind of
museum.
</p>

<p>
Beside me sat a man. His face was hairless, but neither old nor young. He wore
clothes that looked like the grey ashes of paper that had burned and kept its
shape. He was looking at me quietly, but with no particular surprise or
interest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; I said, eager to begin; &ldquo;where am I? Who are you?
What year is this; is it the year 3000, or what is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He drew in his breath with a look of annoyance on his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a queer, excited way you have of speaking,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said again, &ldquo;is this the year 3000?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I know what you mean,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but really I
haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea. I should think it must be at least that,
within a hundred years or so; but nobody has kept track of them for so long,
it&rsquo;s hard to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you keep track of them any more?&rdquo; I gasped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We used to,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I myself can remember that a
century or two ago there were still a number of people who used to try to keep
track of the year, but it died out along with so many other faddish things of
that kind. Why,&rdquo; he continued, showing for the first time a sort of
animation in his talk, &ldquo;what was the use of it? You see, after we
eliminated death&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eliminated death!&rdquo; I cried, sitting upright. &ldquo;Good
God!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was that expression you used?&rdquo; queried the man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; I repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;never heard it before. But I was saying that
after we had eliminated Death, and Food, and Change, we had practically got rid
of Events, and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; I said, my brain reeling. &ldquo;Tell me one thing at a
time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;I see, you must have been asleep a
long time. Go on then and ask questions. Only, if you don&rsquo;t mind, just as
few as possible, and please don&rsquo;t get interested or excited.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough the first question that sprang to my lips was&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are those clothes made of?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Asbestos,&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;They last hundreds of years.
We have one suit each, and there are billions of them piled up, if anybody
wants a new one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Now tell me where I am?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are in a museum. The figures in the cases are specimens like
yourself. But here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you want really to find out about
what is evidently a new epoch to you, get off your platform and come out on
Broadway and sit on a bench.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I got down.
</p>

<p>
As we passed through the dim and dust-covered buildings I looked curiously at
the figures in the cases.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; I said looking at one figure in blue clothes with a belt
and baton, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a policeman!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said my new acquaintance, &ldquo;is <i>that</i> what a
<i>policeman</i> was? I&rsquo;ve often wondered. What used they to be used
for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Used for?&rdquo; I repeated in perplexity. &ldquo;Why, they stood at the
corner of the street.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, I see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so as to shoot at the people. You
must excuse my ignorance,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;as to some of your social
customs in the past. When I took my education I was operated upon for social
history, but the stuff they used was very inferior.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I didn&rsquo;t in the least understand what the man meant, but had no time to
question him, for at that moment we came out upon the street, and I stood
riveted in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
Broadway! Was it possible? The change was absolutely appalling! In place of the
roaring thoroughfare that I had known, this silent, moss-grown desolation.
Great buildings fallen into ruin through the sheer stress of centuries of wind
and weather, the sides of them coated over with a growth of fungus and moss!
The place was soundless. Not a vehicle moved. There were no wires
overhead&mdash;no sound of life or movement except, here and there, there
passed slowly to and fro human figures dressed in the same asbestos clothes as
my acquaintance, with the same hairless faces, and the same look of infinite
age upon them.
</p>

<p>
Good heavens! And was this the era of the Conquest that I had hoped to see! I
had always taken for granted, I do not know why, that humanity was destined to
move forward. This picture of what seemed desolation on the ruins of our
civilisation rendered me almost speechless.
</p>

<p>
There were little benches placed here and there on the street. We sat down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Improved, isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; said man in asbestos, &ldquo;since the
days when you remember it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He seemed to speak quite proudly.
</p>

<p>
I gasped out a question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where are the street cars and the motors?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, done away with long ago,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;how awful they must
have been. The noise of them!&rdquo; and his asbestos clothes rustled with a
shudder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how do you get about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Why should we? It&rsquo;s
just the same being here as being anywhere else.&rdquo; He looked at me with an
infinity of dreariness in his face.
</p>

<p>
A thousand questions surged into my mind at once. I asked one of the simplest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how do you get back and forwards to your work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Work!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any work. It&rsquo;s
finished. The last of it was all done centuries ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I looked at him a moment open-mouthed. Then I turned and looked again at the
grey desolation of the street with the asbestos figures moving here and there.
</p>

<p>
I tried to pull my senses together. I realised that if I was to unravel this
new and undreamed-of future, I must go at it systematically and step by step.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I said after a pause, &ldquo;that momentous things have
happened since my time. I wish you would let me ask you about it all
systematically, and would explain it to me bit by bit. First, what do you mean
by saying that there is no work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered my strange acquaintance, &ldquo;it died out of
itself. Machinery killed it. If I remember rightly, you had a certain amount of
machinery even in your time. You had done very well with steam, made a good
beginning with electricity, though I think radial energy had hardly as yet been
put to use.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you found it did you no good. The better your machines, the harder
you worked. The more things you had the more you wanted. The pace of life grew
swifter and swifter. You cried out, but it would not stop. You were all caught
in the cogs of your own machine. None of you could see the end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;How do you know it all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered the Man in Asbestos, &ldquo;that part of my
education was very well operated&mdash;I see you do not know what I mean. Never
mind, I can tell you that later. Well, then, there came, probably almost two
hundred years after your time, the Era of the Great Conquest of Nature, the
final victory of Man and Machinery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They did conquer it?&rdquo; I asked quickly, with a thrill of the old
hope in my veins again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Conquered it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;beat it out! Fought it to a
standstill! Things came one by one, then faster and faster, in a hundred years
it was all done. In fact, just as soon as mankind turned its energy to
decreasing its needs instead of increasing its desires, the whole thing was
easy. Chemical Food came first. Heavens! the simplicity of it. And in your time
thousands of millions of people tilled and grubbed at the soil from morning
till night. I&rsquo;ve seen specimens of them&mdash;farmers, they called them.
There&rsquo;s one in the museum. After the invention of Chemical Food we piled
up enough in the emporiums in a year to last for centuries. Agriculture went
overboard. Eating and all that goes with it, domestic labour,
housework&mdash;all ended. Nowadays one takes a concentrated pill every year or
so, that&rsquo;s all. The whole digestive apparatus, as you knew it, was a
clumsy thing that had been bloated up like a set of bagpipes through the
evolution of its use!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I could not forbear to interrupt. &ldquo;Have you and these people,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;no stomachs&mdash;no apparatus?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course we have,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but we use it to some
purpose. Mine is largely filled with my education&mdash;but there! I am
anticipating again. Better let me go on as I was. Chemical Food came first:
that cut off almost one-third of the work, and then came Asbestos Clothes. That
was wonderful! In one year humanity made enough suits to last for ever and
ever. That, of course, could never have been if it hadn&rsquo;t been connected
with the revolt of women and the fall of Fashion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have the Fashions gone,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;that insane, extravagant
idea of&mdash;&rdquo; I was about to launch into one of my old-time harangues
about the sheer vanity of decorative dress, when my eye rested on the moving
figures in asbestos, and I stopped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All gone,&rdquo; said the Man in Asbestos. &ldquo;Then next to that we
killed, or practically killed, the changes of climate. I don&rsquo;t think that
in your day you properly understood how much of your work was due to the shifts
of what you called the weather. It meant the need of all kinds of special
clothes and houses and shelters, a wilderness of work. How dreadful it must
have been in your day&mdash;wind and storms, great wet masses&mdash;what did
you call them?&mdash;clouds&mdash;flying through the air, the ocean full of
salt, was it not?&mdash;tossed and torn by the wind, snow thrown all over
everything, hail, rain&mdash;how awful!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it was very beautiful. But how did you
alter it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Killed the weather!&rdquo; answered the Man in Asbestos. &ldquo;Simple
as anything&mdash;turned its forces loose one against the other, altered the
composition of the sea so that the top became all more or less gelatinous. I
really can&rsquo;t explain it, as it is an operation that I never took at
school, but it made the sky grey, as you see it, and the sea gum-coloured, the
weather all the same. It cut out fuel and houses and an infinity of work with
them!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment. I began to realise something of the course of evolution
that had happened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the conquest of nature meant that presently
there was no more work to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nothing left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Food enough for all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Houses and clothes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All you like,&rdquo; said the Man in Asbestos, waving his hand.
&ldquo;There they are. Go out and take them. Of course, they&rsquo;re falling
down&mdash; slowly, very slowly. But they&rsquo;ll last for centuries yet,
nobody need bother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then I realised, I think for the first time, just what work had meant in the
old life, and how much of the texture of life itself had been bound up in the
keen effort of it.
</p>

<p>
Presently my eyes looked upward: dangling at the top of a moss-grown building I
saw what seemed to be the remains of telephone wires.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What became of all that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the telegraph and the
telephone and all the system of communication?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Man in Asbestos, &ldquo;that was what a telephone
meant, was it? I knew that it had been suppressed centuries ago. Just what was
it for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I said with enthusiasm, &ldquo;by means of the telephone we
could talk to anybody, call up anybody, and talk at any distance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And anybody could call you up at any time and talk?&rdquo; said the Man
in Asbestos, with something like horror. &ldquo;How awful! What a dreadful age
yours was, to be sure. No, the telephone and all the rest of it, all the
transportation and intercommunication was cut out and forbidden. There was no
sense in it. You see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what you don&rsquo;t realise is
that people after your day became gradually more and more reasonable. Take the
railroad, what good was that? It brought into every town a lot of people from
every other town. Who wanted them? Nobody. When work stopped and commerce
ended, and food was needless, and the weather killed, it was foolish to move
about. So it was all terminated. Anyway,&rdquo; he said, with a quick look of
apprehension and a change in his voice, &ldquo;it was dangerous!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Dangerous! You still have danger?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s always the danger of
getting broken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean,&rdquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the Man in Asbestos, &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s what
you would call being dead. Of course, in one sense there&rsquo;s been no death
for centuries past; we cut that out. Disease and death were simply a matter of
germs. We found them one by one. I think that even in your day you had found
one or two of the easier, the bigger ones?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you had found diphtheria and typhoid and, if I am right, there were
some outstanding, like scarlet fever and smallpox, that you called
ultra-microscopic, and which you were still hunting for, and others that you
didn&rsquo;t even suspect. Well, we hunted them down one by one and destroyed
them. Strange that it never occurred to any of you that Old Age was only a
germ! It turned out to be quite a simple one, but it was so distributed in its
action that you never even thought of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you mean to say,&rdquo; I ejaculated in amazement, looking at the
Man in Asbestos, &ldquo;that nowadays you live for ever?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you hadn&rsquo;t that peculiar,
excitable way of talking; you speak as if everything <i>mattered</i> so
tremendously. Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we live for ever, unless, of
course, we get broken. That happens sometimes. I mean that we may fall over a
high place or bump on something, and snap ourselves. You see, we&rsquo;re just
a little brittle still&mdash;some remnant, I suppose, of the Old Age
germ&mdash;and we have to be careful. In fact,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mind saying that accidents of this sort were the most distressing
feature of our civilisation till we took steps to cut out all accidents. We
forbid all street cars, street traffic, aeroplanes, and so on. The risks of
your time,&rdquo; he said, with a shiver of his asbestos clothes, &ldquo;must
have been awful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; I answered, with a new kind of pride in my generation
that I had never felt before, &ldquo;but we thought it part of the duty of
brave people to&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the Man in Asbestos impatiently, &ldquo;please
don&rsquo;t get excited. I know what you mean. It was quite irrational.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We sat silent for a long time. I looked about me at the crumbling buildings,
the monotone, unchanging sky, and the dreary, empty street. Here, then, was the
fruit of the Conquest, here was the elimination of work, the end of hunger and
of cold, the cessation of the hard struggle, the downfall of change and
death&mdash;nay, the very millennium of happiness. And yet, somehow, there
seemed something wrong with it all. I pondered, then I put two or three rapid
questions, hardly waiting to reflect upon the answers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there any war now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Done with centuries ago. They took to settling international disputes
with a slot machine. After that all foreign dealings were given up. Why have
them? Everybody thinks foreigners awful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are there any newspapers now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Newspapers! What on earth would we want them for? If we should need them
at any time there are thousands of old ones piled up. But what is in them,
anyway; only things that <i>happen</i>, wars and accidents and work and death.
When these went newspapers went too. Listen,&rdquo; continued the Man in
Asbestos, &ldquo;you seem to have been something of a social reformer, and yet
you don&rsquo;t understand the new life at all. You don&rsquo;t understand how
completely all our burdens have disappeared. Look at it this way. How used your
people to spend all the early part of their lives?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;our first fifteen years or so were spent in
getting education.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;now notice how we improved on all
that. Education in our day is done by surgery. Strange that in your time nobody
realised that education was simply a surgical operation. You hadn&rsquo;t the
sense to see that what you really did was to slowly remodel, curve and
convolute the inside of the brain by a long and painful mental operation.
Everything learned was reproduced in a physical difference to the brain. You
knew that, but you didn&rsquo;t see the full consequences. Then came the
invention of surgical education&mdash;the simple system of opening the side of
the skull and engrafting into it a piece of prepared brain. At first, of
course, they had to use, I suppose, the brains of dead people, and that was
ghastly&rdquo;&mdash;here the Man in Asbestos shuddered like a
leaf&mdash;&ldquo;but very soon they found how to make moulds that did just as
well. After that it was a mere nothing; an operation of a few minutes would
suffice to let in poetry or foreign languages or history or anything else that
one cared to have. Here, for instance,&rdquo; he added, pushing back the hair
at the side of his head and showing a scar beneath it, &ldquo;is the mark where
I had my spherical trigonometry let in. That was, I admit, rather painful, but
other things, such as English poetry or history, can be inserted absolutely
without the least suffering. When I think of your painful, barbarous methods of
education through the ear, I shudder at it. Oddly enough, we have found lately
that for a great many things there is no need to use the head. We lodge
them&mdash;things like philosophy and metaphysics, and so on&mdash;in what used
to be the digestive apparatus. They fill it admirably.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment. Then went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, to continue, what used to occupy your time and effort after
your education?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;one had, of course, to work, and then, to
tell the truth, a great part of one&rsquo;s time and feeling was devoted toward
the other sex, towards falling in love and finding some woman to share
one&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Man in Asbestos, with real interest.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about your arrangements with the women, but never quite
understood them. Tell me; you say you selected some woman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And she became what you called your wife?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you worked for her?&rdquo; asked the Man in Asbestos in
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And she did not work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;of course not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And half of what you had was hers?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And she had the right to live in your house and use your things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; said the Man in Asbestos. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t
realised the horrors of your age till now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sat shivering slightly, with the same timid look in his face as before.
</p>

<p>
Then it suddenly struck me that of the figures on the street, all had looked
alike.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are there no women now? Are they gone
too?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered the Man in Asbestos, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re here
just the same. Some of those are women. Only, you see, everything has been
changed now. It all came as part of their great revolt, their desire to be like
the men. Had that begun in your time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only a little.&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;they were beginning to ask for
votes and equality.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said my acquaintance, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
think of the word. Your women, I believe, were something awful, were they not?
Covered with feathers and skins and dazzling colours made of dead things all
over them? And they laughed, did they not, and had foolish teeth, and at any
moment they could inveigle you into one of those contracts! Ugh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shuddered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Asbestos,&rdquo; I said (I knew no other name to call him), as I turned
on him in wrath, &ldquo;Asbestos, do you think that those jelly-bag Equalities
out on the street there, with their ash-barrel suits, can be compared for one
moment with our unredeemed, unreformed, heaven-created, hobble-skirted women of
the twentieth century?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then, suddenly, another thought flashed into my mind&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The children,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;where are the children? Are there
any?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no! I have never heard of there being
any such things for at least a century. Horrible little hobgoblins they must
have been! Great big faces, and cried constantly! And <i>grew</i>, did they
not? Like funguses! I believe they were longer each year than they had been the
last, and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Asbestos!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this, then, is your coming Civilisation,
your millennium. This dull, dead thing, with the work and the burden gone out
of life, and with them all the joy and sweetness of it. For the old
struggle&mdash;mere stagnation, and in place of danger and death, the dull
monotony of security and the horror of an unending decay! Give me back,&rdquo;
I cried, and I flung wide my arms to the dull air, &ldquo;the old life of
danger and stress, with its hard toil and its bitter chances, and its
heartbreaks. I see its value! I know its worth! Give me no rest,&rdquo; I cried
aloud&mdash;
</p>

<hr />

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but give a rest to the rest of the corridor!&rdquo; cried an
angered voice that broke in upon my exultation.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly my sleep had gone.
</p>

<p>
I was back again in the room of my hotel, with the hum of the wicked, busy old
world all about me, and loud in my ears the voice of the indignant man across
the corridor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quit your blatting, you infernal blatherskite,&rdquo; he was calling.
&ldquo;Come down to earth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I came.
